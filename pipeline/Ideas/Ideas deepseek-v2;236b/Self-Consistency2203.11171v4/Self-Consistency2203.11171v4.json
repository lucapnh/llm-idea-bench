        "Short Hypothesis": "By training an ensemble of language models to prioritize consistency across diverse reasoning paths, we can improve the accuracy and reliability on complex multi-choice question answering tasks without overfitting to a single metric.",
        "Related Work": "Building upon studies like MEDIQA-CORR 2024 and Multi2 framework for MDS, our proposal introduces an ensemble approach where each model is trained with a focus on consistency while avoiding the pitfalls of positional bias or reliance on a singular 'best' prompt. We aim to refine the training process to prevent overfitting to specific metrics while leveraging diverse prompts effectively.",
        "Abstract": "We present EnsembleConsistencyOptimization, a novel training methodology for language model ensembles that emphasizes consistency across reasoning paths without sacrificing diversity in problem-solving approaches. Our method involves developing an ensemble of models where each member is trained with a loss function that encourages consistent yet varied responses to complex multi-choice questions. We hypothesize that this approach will yield more accurate and reliable answers by leveraging the strengths of multiple models while mitigating individual biases. To validate our hypothesis, we plan to conduct rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets such as GSM8K and ARC-Challenge, comparing our method against traditional single model approaches and other ensemble techniques. Additionally, we propose innovative metrics that account for positional bias and assess the quality of summaries or responses holistically. Our goal is to demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy without overfitting to a specific consistency metric while exploring practical scaling boundaries for complex reasoning tasks.",

This RL-driven selection process is designed to adaptively learn from feedback on task performance, ensuring efficient use of computational resources and coherence in reasoning across various tasks. Our approach builds upon the insights from 'CL-CoTNav' regarding hierarchical chain-of-thought prompting but extends it by focusing specifically on the dynamic path selection problem within a single model architecture.",

The RL agent is trained using feedback on task performance, allowing it to learn the most effective pathway selection strategies for different problem contexts. To validate our hypothesis, we will conduct experiments on benchmark datasets that span various domains, including but not limited to arithmetic reasoning, commonsense knowledge, and complex question-answering tasks.
