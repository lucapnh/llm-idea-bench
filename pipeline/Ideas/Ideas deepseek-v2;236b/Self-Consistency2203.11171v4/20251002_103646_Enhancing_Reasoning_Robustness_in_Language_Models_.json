Mohammadreza Pourreza, Hailong Li, Ruoxi Sun, Yeounoh Chung, Shayan Talaei, Gaurav Tarlok Kakkar, Yu Gan, Amin Saberi, Fatma Ozcan, Sercan \u00d6. Arik. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 73\nAbstract: In tackling the challenges of large language model (LLM) performance for Text-to-SQL tasks, we introduce CHASE-SQL, a new framework that employs innovative strategies, using test-time compute in multi-agent modeling to improve candidate generation and selection. CHASE-SQL leverages LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to generate diverse and high-quality SQL candidates using different LLM generators with: (1) a divide-and-conquer method that decomposes complex queries into manageable sub-queries in a single LLM call; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning based on query execution plans, reflecting the steps a database engine takes during execution; and (3) a unique instance-aware synthetic example generation technique, which offers specific few-shot demonstrations tailored to test questions.To identify the best candidate, a selection agent is employed to rank the candidates through pairwise comparisons with a fine-tuned binary-candidates selection LLM. This selection approach has been demonstrated to be more robust over alternatives. The proposed generators-selector framework not only enhances the quality and diversity of SQL queries but also outperforms previous methods. Overall, our proposed CHASE-SQL achieves the state-of-the-art execution accuracy of 73.0% and 73.01% on the test set and development set of the notable BIRD Text-to-SQL dataset benchmark, rendering CHASE-SQL the top submission of the leaderboard (at the time of paper submission).",

Mingyu Jin, Haochen Xue, Zhenting Wang, Boming Kang, Ruosong Ye, Kaixiong Zhou, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang. bioRxiv, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 15\nAbstract: The prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding biological functions and diseases. Previous machine learning approaches to PPI prediction mainly focus on direct physical interactions, ignoring the broader context of nonphysical connections through intermediate proteins, thus limiting their effectiveness. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a new opportunity for addressing this complex biological challenge. By transforming structured data into natural language prompts, we can map the relationships between proteins into texts. This approach allows LLMs to identify indirect connections between proteins, tracing the path from upstream to downstream. Therefore, we propose a novel framework ProLLM that employs an LLM tailored for PPI for the first time. Specifically, we propose Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT), which replicates the biological mechanism of signaling pathways as natural language prompts. ProCoT considers a signaling pathway as a protein reasoning process, which starts from upstream proteins and passes through several intermediate proteins to transmit biological signals to downstream proteins. Thus, we can use ProCoT to predict the interaction between upstream proteins and downstream proteins. The training of ProLLM employs the ProCoT format, which enhances the model\u2019s understanding of complex biological problems. In addition to ProCoT, this paper also contributes to the exploration of embedding replacement of protein sites in natural language prompts, and instruction fine-tuning in protein knowledge datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProLLM through rigorous validation against benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to transform the field of PPI, serving as a robust potential tool for various categories of biological and medical research.

Yau, Chen Lv. arXiv.org, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Visual Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) requires a robot to locate a target object in an unseen environment using egocentric observations. However, decision-making policies often struggle to transfer to unseen environments and novel target objects, which is the core generalization problem. Traditional end-to-end learning methods exacerbate this issue, as they rely on memorizing spatial patterns rather than employing structured reasoning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively. In this letter, we introduce Closed-Loop Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Navigation (CL-CoTNav), a vision-language model (VLM)-driven ObjectNav framework that integrates structured reasoning and closed-loop feedback into navigation decision-making. To enhance generalization, we fine-tune a VLM using multi-turn question-answering (QA) data derived from human demonstration trajectories. This structured dataset enables hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT) prompting, systematically extracting compositional knowledge to refine perception and decision-making, inspired by the human cognitive process of locating a target object through iterative reasoning steps. Additionally, we propose a Closed-Loop H-CoT mechanism that incorporates detection and reasoning confidence scores into training. This adaptive weighting strategy guides the model to prioritize high-confidence data pairs, mitigating the impact of noisy inputs and enhancing robustness against hallucinated or incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments in the AI Habitat environment demonstrate CL-CoTNav's superior generalization to unseen scenes and novel object categories. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in navigation success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) by 22.4\\%.

Ziyang Luo, Nian Liu, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Junwei Han. arXiv.org, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues, we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training\"stage utilizes self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes effectively to unreferenced segmentation.",
