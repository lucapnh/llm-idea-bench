A. Abdel-Reheim, Mahmoud E. Youssef. The FASEB Journal, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: Citicoline, a compound produced naturally in small amounts in the human body, assumes a pivotal role in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, a dynamic constituent of membranes of neurons. Across diverse models of brain injury and neurodegeneration, citicoline has demonstrated its potential through neuroprotective and anti\u2010inflammatory effects. This review aims to elucidate citicoline's anti\u2010inflammatory mechanism and its clinical implications in conditions such as ischemic stroke, head trauma, glaucoma, and age\u2010associated memory impairment. Citicoline's anti\u2010inflammatory prowess is rooted in its ability to stabilize cellular membranes, thereby curbing the excessive release of glutamate\u2014a pro\u2010inflammatory neurotransmitter. Moreover, it actively diminishes free radicals and inflammatory cytokines productions, which could otherwise harm neurons and incite neuroinflammation. It also exhibits the potential to modulate microglia activity, the brain's resident immune cells, and hinder the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, a transcription factor governing inflammatory genes. Clinical trials have subjected citicoline to rigorous scrutiny in patients grappling with acute ischemic stroke, head trauma, glaucoma, and age\u2010related memory impairment. While findings from these trials are mixed, numerous studies suggest that citicoline could confer improvements in neurological function, disability reduction, expedited recovery, and cognitive decline prevention within these cohorts. Additionally, citicoline boasts a favorable safety profile and high tolerability. In summary, citicoline stands as a promising agent, wielding both neuroprotective and anti\u2010inflammatory potential across a spectrum of neurological conditions. However, further research is imperative to delineate the optimal dosage, treatment duration, and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, identifying specific patient subgroups most likely to reap the benefits of citicoline as a new therapy remains a critical avenue for exploration.",

Bonnet. Haematologica, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: In this study we show that dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can quantify the impact of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on bone marrow (BM) vasculature by optimizing an in vivo DCE-MRI method and assessing the method\u2019s diagnostic and prognostic potential. AML, the most common acute leukemia in adults, is a very heterogeneous disease with regard to both its genetic basis and outcome of treatment. The BM microenvironment is important because leukemia cells are able to change the functions of normal tissues, favoring proliferation of the cells and protecting them from external harm. BM vascular remodeling induced by AML cells favors a more hypoxic microenvironment, and is thought to protect leukemia stem cells from therapy, being a poor prognostic factor in AML. Most preclinical studies use microscopy-based methods to assess environmental changes, namely vascular leakiness and perfusion, leaving little space for direct translation of the optimized methodology. In the clinic, perfusion imaging is an important tool in the diagnosis and management of various diseases. The advantages of using MRI for perfusion imaging are its superiority in terms of soft tissue contrast, absence of ionizing radiation (compared to computerized tomography and nuclear imaging such as positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography) and the possibility of imaging larger body areas or even the whole body. DCE-MRI is a method commonly used to measure perfusion. DCEMRI quantifies signal changes due to the passing of a contrast agent through the imaging area. By modeling the signal kinetics, it is possible to quantify vascular parameters such as perfusion, leakiness, and blood volume. Even though it has been around for over 20 years, DCE-MRI has not yet been fully implemented in many clinical pathways because of the lack of standardization in image acquisition and analysis methods, rendering it mostly a research-based tool. We used DCE-MRI to quantify the impact of human AML on BM vasculature in an animal model. In-house MatLab scripts were used to quantify non-model-based parameters taken directly from the contrast agent kinetic curves (see below). The parameters quantified are illustrated in Figure 1A. Changes in the first part of the DCE curve reflect blood flow and blood volume, while changes in the second part of the DCE curve reflect changes in vascular permeability and extravascular space (Figure 1A). We have previously reported that leukemia induces BM vascular leakiness, using intravital imaging of the calvaria, which was not observed in mice injected with cord blood (Online Supplementary Figure S1A, B), when compared to healthy, age-matched mice that were not injected (NI). To test the sensitivity of DCE-MRI in quantifying leukemia-induced BM vascular dysfunction, three different leukemia cell lines were used (U937, HL60, and ML1), and mice were scanned at different stages of the disease (Online Supplementary Figure S1C). When compared to healthy, age-matched NI controls, leukemia mice showed altered BM DCE kinetics (Figure 1B), with reduced contrast enhancement (CE; BM vascular density), reduced wash-in rate (WiR; blood flow), increased initial wash-out rate and wash-out rate (iWoR and WoR; vascular permeability and extravascular space) (Figure 1C). BM vascular dysfunction was not dependent on high leukemia burden, as even low levels of leukemia engraftment (<20% mCD45hCD33 cells present in the BM) significantly altered BM vascular function (Figure 1C, open circles). Leukemia is known to promote angiogenesis, but with disorganized and leaky vessels. The reduced CE in our leukemia cohort is in agreement with this, as CE relates to the proportion of functional blood vessels per pixel. With deregulated BM vascular parameters correlating with aging in healthy mice (Online Supplementary Figure S1D), we compared younger (12-16 weeks) versus older (19-32 weeks) mice to understand whether age was affecting leukemia-induced BM vascular dysfunction. As shown in Online Supplementary Figure S1D, older, NI mice showed significantly reduced BM vascular density and increased BM vascular permeability, but we observed no effect of age in leukemia-injected mice (Figure 1C). This indicates that aging and leukemia seem to alter BM vascular permeability (WoR) and functional density (CE) to a similar extent. However, decreased BM blood flow/perfusion (WiR) seems to be a leukemia-specific effect, as it was the only parameter unaltered by aging (Online Supplementary Figure S1E). In fact, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis highlighted WiR as the best parameter for distinguishing healthy from leukemic BM (Figure 1D; AUCWiR = 1.000). Differences in vascular density and function between different areas of the bone have been reported. Using intravital two-photon imaging of the calvaria, we confirmed that at early stages of the disease the areas of leukemia engraftment (GFP cells) coincided with areas of reduced perfusion and irregular vessel structure, confirming a heterogeneous vascular dysfunction linked with leukemia burden (Online Supplementary Figure S1F). For this reason, we hypothesize that averaged DCE-MRI parameters could have some limitations in heterogeneous and low-engrafted mice. To obtain a detailed picture of DCE-MRI-measured vascular aberrations and evaluate their spatial distribution along the femur, we performed pixel-by-pixel (pbp, with each pixel corresponding to an area of ~200 mm) analysis for three DCEMRI parameters: CE, WiR, and WoR. NI mice present a homogeneous distribution of functional vessels in the epiphysis and along the endosteum of the diaphysis (Figure 1E, CE); high vascular perfusion in the central marrow of the diaphysis (Figure 1E, WiR), and higher vascular permeability at the epiphysis and in proximity with the endosteum of the diaphysis. In the presence of AML, there is an aberrant, heterogeneous distribution of these parameters along the femur. In groups injected with HL60 and ML1, pbp analysis highlighted areas (pockets) with severe vascular dysfunction (Figure 1E, white rectangles), surrounded by less affected vasculature. Importantly, areas that showed lower functional vascular density (low CE) corresponded to areas in which both the vascular perfusion (WiR) and permeability (WoR) were mostly affected (Figure 1E, white rectangles). In the group injected with U937 cells, there were no obvious pockets of vascular dysfunction, with this being present throughout the femur. Thus, our pbp analysis approach was successful in resolving the spatial distribution of vascular parameters along the femur and unveiling the heterogeneity of vascular dysfunction in AML xenografts. To further test the clinical potential of BM DCE-MRI, we scanned mice engrafted with samples from AML patients (i.e., with patient-derived xenografts, PDX). Different AML samples had different engraftment capacities (Online Supplementary Figure S2A) and DCE kinetics (Figure 2A), echoing the heterogeneous nature of this dis-",

You, Ren-Cheng Zheng, Shen Zhao, He Wang, Yizhou Jiang, Ya-Jia Gu, Zhiming Shao. Cancer Research, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: \n Background: Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) refers to variations observed among cancer cells within a single tumor, posing significant challenges in clinical practice due to its contribution to treatment resistance and unfavorable outcome. However, the inconvenience of multi-region biopsy and limitations of genomic sequencing based on limited tissue impede the practical detection of ITH. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a non-invasive method that comprehensively captures ITH from a holistic perspective of the entire tumor. Methods: We utilized a large multicenter dataset comprising dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images from breast cancer patients (n = 1423) along with matched multiomics data (n = 468) to develop a non-invasive machine learning approach for measuring ITH. We extracted quantitative radiomic features from both the entire tumor and peritumor regions, with a specific focus on features associated with imaging heterogeneity. Using these radiomic features, we established an imaging ITH (IITH) model. The robustness of IITH evaluation was determined by assessing its correlation with genomic ITH (employing the mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity [MATH] algorithm) and pathological cellular ITH (analyzing variation in quantitative nuclear features extracted through digital pathology). Prognostic power was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses. Integrated multiomics analyses were performed to investigate the molecular basis of different IITH subgroups. Results: We developed a non-invasive radiomic signature to quantify imaging ITH (IITH) in the FUSCC cohort. Breast cancer patients were retrospectively categorized into high and low IITH groups. Multivariate Cox analysis identified high IITH as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, even after adjusting for clinical risk factors such as tumor size, positive lymph nodes, clinical subtype and lymphovascular invasion status. These findings were further validated in the DUKE cohort, confirming the prognostic value of IITH. Moreover, we substantiated the robustness of IITH by demonstrating its association with genomic and pathological ITH. Multiomics analysis revealed the activation of oncogenic pathways and metabolic dysregulation in high-IITH tumors. Intriguingly, our investigation also highlighted ferroptosis as a vulnerability and potential therapeutic target in high-IITH tumors, which was further supported by evidence from the TCGA cohort. Conclusion: Radiomic-based assessment of ITH provides a non-invasive approach to comprehensively capture ITH and predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Targeting ferroptosis may hold promise as a treatment strategy for patients with high IITH.\n Citation Format: Guan-Hua Su, Yi Xiao, Chao You, Ren-Cheng Zheng, Shen Zhao, He Wang, Yi-Zhou Jiang, Ya-Jia Gu, Zhi-Ming Shao.

High-throughput genomic technologies have yielded insights regarding the molecular underpinnings and heterogeneity of PDAC. Systemic treatment options are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapies, except for approx. 10%, who receive targeted treatment based on genomic profiling. PDO\u2019s are three-dimensional\n ex vivo\n experimental models grown directly from tumor tissue and can provide a direct assessment of drug response. By directly exposing cancer cells to potential drug therapies, functional profiling provides a dynamic measurement of response that is more informative than static gene panels. PDOs can theoretically be used to direct therapeutic decisions, offering an opportunity to expand the reach of precision therapies for PDAC beyond genomics. To date, PDO testing has been limited by small sample sizes, few drugs included in the screens, and retrospective studies. To expand the impact of precision therapy, we developed a rapid high-throughput screening (HTS) platform where over 3,000 drugs can be tested in PDOs within 8-10 weeks of diagnosis. In ADOPT, we aim to formally investigate the efficacy of PDO-directed therapy in a prospective phase II study, leveraging our existing platforms using real-time HTS of PDOs\n .\n This study represents one of the first formal trials of PDO-directed therapy in solid tumors. Our novel approach will enroll pts with advanced PDAC who do not have alternative treatment options.\n Methods:\n This is an actively recruiting prospective, single-arm phase II trial.

Discover Oncology, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Background The heterogeneity in outcomes of breast cancer liver metastasis (BCLM) complicates prognosis assessment. This study conducted conditional survival (CS) analysis and develop a CS-nomogram model for BCLM using SEER database data, providing individualized and adaptive prognostic predictions. Methods Data were extracted from the SEER 18 database, encompassing clinical records of BCLM patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2021. CS was calculated using the formula CS(t\u2223s)\u2009=\u2009S(t\u2009+\u2009s)/S(s), allowing for the dynamic assessment of survival probabilities. Annual hazard rate (AHR) analysis was performed to evaluate the risk of mortality at specific time intervals. A two-stage feature selection process was used to identify prognostic factors. We then developed a CS-nomogram, validated through calibration curves, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results The study cohort comprised 4,702 BCLM patients. The CS analysis and AHR analysis demonstrated that survival probabilities improved progressively for patients who survived beyond the high-risk period, particularly during the first year post-diagnosis. The CS-nomogram, developed using Cox regression, incorporated 14 variables, including patient characteristics, tumor features, and treatment information. It effectively predicted overall survival and CS at 3, 5, and 10 years. The model\u2019s clinical utility was confirmed through calibrations, ROC with area under the curve values, and DCA, offering valuable insights for individualized treatment decisions. Conclusion By incorporating CS analysis, this study provided a dynamic, adaptable approach to predict prognosis for BCLMs. The CS-nomogram model transformed survival probabilities into a continuously adjustable process, supporting more precise clinical decision-making and offering hope to patients with a historically poor prognosis.

Cancer immunology research, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: \n Background: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are critical for the adaptive immune system, enabling T-cells to detect and eliminate cancer cells. Many cancers evade immune surveillance by altering MHC expression, leading to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Understanding MHC regulation in normal and cancerous states is essential for developing effective immunotherapies. Previous studies using bulk RNA-sequencing failed to measure cancer cell-specific MHC expression accurately. This study aims to decode MHC transcriptional regulation in healthy tissues and cancers using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets and targeted CRISPR screens. Methods: We utilized a large-scale scRNA-seq dataset encompassing 18 tissues and 124 epithelial cell types to study MHC class I (MHCI) and class II (MHCII) regulation at baseline. After re-clustering and annotation, we investigated MHC expression across various cell types and tissues, quantifying heterogeneity using the Gini coefficient. We employed a master regulator inference approach with uni- and multi-regression models to identify transcription factors (TFs) predictive of MHC expression. To investigate MHC dysregulation in cancer, we curated 43 scRNA-seq datasets across 20 cancer types and 538 patients. Results: We observed an \u223c8-fold range in MHCI expression across normal epithelial cell types, with notable MHCII expression in prostate club cells and cholangiocytes of the liver. Our approach nominated 104 TFs for MHCI and 107 for MHCII, including novel regulators like YBX1 and XBP1. In our pan-cancer analysis, we found widespread repression of MHC genes, with significant heterogeneity in MHCII expression among colon cancer patients correlating with mismatch repair deficiency. In prostate cancer, MYC-mediated pathways led to MHCI suppression, revealing a novel immune evasion mechanism. In an ICB cohort, TFs such as XBP1 and SP100 were strong predictors of patient survival. This work has resulted in a data descriptor to make single-cell ICB data accessible. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of MHC expression across 124 cell types and 20 cancers, identifying TFs predictive of MHCI and MHCII expression. By uncovering novel regulatory mechanisms and potential immune evasion strategies, this research contributes valuable insights into MHC regulation in normal and cancerous tissues. The identification of YBX1 and XBP1 as potential regulators opens new avenues for targeted therapies. The correlation between MHCII upregulation and mismatch repair deficiency suggests a potential biomarker for immunotherapy response. The discovery of MYC-mediated MHCI suppression provides a new target for enhancing immune recognition. These findings have important implications for understanding cancer immune evasion and may inform the development of more effective immunotherapies and predictive biomarkers for ICB response. Future work will focus on experimental validation of these computational findings and exploring their clinical applications in cancer immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Mahnoor Gondal, Yi Bao, Rahul Mannan, Jing Hu, Arul Chinnaiyan, Marcin Cieslik.
