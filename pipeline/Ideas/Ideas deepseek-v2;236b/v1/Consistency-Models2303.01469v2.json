        "Short Hypothesis": "Optimal control techniques applied to the probability flow ODE underlying diffusion models can yield a new class of generative models that achieve faster sampling rates without compromising image quality.",
        "Related Work": "This proposal builds upon recent advances in consistency models (e.g., 'Consistency Models' by Song et al.) and diffusion model distillation, which have shown promise in reducing the number of steps required for high-quality generation. However, these methods still rely on heuristics or iterative refinement that may not be optimal for all data distributions. Our approach integrates insights from control theory to systematically optimize the sampling process, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical optimality and practical efficiency.",
        "Abstract": "Generative models based on diffusion processes have demonstrated remarkable success in synthesizing high-quality images; however, their iterative nature limits real-time applications. This paper introduces ODEGen, a novel framework that leverages optimal control theory to systematically refine the sampling trajectory within the probability flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) governing diffusion models. By formulating the sampling process as an optimization problem with constraints on smoothness and fidelity of image synthesis, we derive a new class of generative models that achieve rapid one-step generation from Gaussian noise while maintaining competitive FID scores. We present two training methodologies: (1) Optimal Control Distillation (OCD), which refines pre-trained diffusion model trajectories using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle; and (2) Direct Optimal Control Training (DOCT), which optimizes the generative flow directly without a teacher network. Our empirical results on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64 demonstrate that ODEGen surpasses existing distillation methods, setting new records for one-step FID scores of 3.35 and 5.90, respectively. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of our approach in zero-shot image editing tasks, highlighting its potential for real-time applications in graphics and design.",
