        "Short Hypothesis": "A transformer-based model can effectively integrate intrinsic curiosity into reinforcement learning by predicting the novelty of future states and actions, leading to improved exploration and learning efficiency.",
        "Related Work": "Existing research on curiosity mechanisms in RL has explored methods like prediction error-driven exploration (e.g., ICM) and count-based exploration. However, these approaches often struggle with scalability and long-term credit assignment issues. Our proposal builds upon the Decision Transformer framework to incorporate a novel intrinsic reward signal based on state novelty predictions using transformers.",
        "Abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative approach to reinforcement learning that leverages transformer models for enhancing agent curiosity. We propose a method where the transformer is trained not only to predict actions in trajectories but also to estimate the novelty of future states, providing an intrinsic reward signal that drives exploration. The model utilizes self-attention mechanisms to assign credit over long horizons and effectively explore environments with sparse extrinsic rewards. Empirical evaluations on challenging tasks such as Montezuma's Revenge demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional RL methods in terms of learning speed, convergence to high-reward policies, and robustness to reward sparsity.",

        "Related Work": "Current policy distillation methods often rely on hand-crafted architectures and loss functions tailored for specific domains.

We propose a framework where expert trajectories, consisting of state-action pairs, are used to train a transformer model to predict actions conditioned on past sequences. The trained transformer then serves as an efficient teacher for distilling its knowledge into smaller, less resource-intensive student models. Our approach employs a novel distillation loss that leverages the self-attention mechanism within transformers to ensure accurate policy replication across various timesteps and states. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional policy distillation techniques on complex tasks such as StarCraft II micromanagement scenarios and continuous control benchmarks like MuJoCo, achieving comparable or superior performance with significantly reduced model complexity.",
