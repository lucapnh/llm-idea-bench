        "Title": "MetaPrompting: Elevating Language Model Performance through Self-Reflexive Prompt Design",
        "Short Hypothesis": "By designing prompts that explicitly encourage language models to reflect on and refine their own reasoning process, we can enhance the model's performance across a range of tasks.",
        "Related Work": "MetaPrompting builds upon the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and ReAct paradigms by introducing an additional layer of self-reflection. Unlike standard CoT which prompts models to generate a chain of thoughts without reflection, and ReAct which interleaves reasoning with actions, MetaPrompting specifically guides the model to introspect on its own thought processes, potentially leading to more accurate outputs.",
        "Abstract": "This proposal introduces MetaPrompting, an innovative prompting strategy that leverages self-reflexive mechanisms within language models. By prompting models not only to reason and act but also to critically evaluate their reasoning steps, we hypothesize a significant improvement in task performance across various domains such as multi-hop question answering, fact verification, and interactive environments like text-based games and online shopping simulations. MetaPrompting differs from existing methods by incorporating an introspective component into the prompt design, allowing models to potentially correct or refine their thought processes mid-task.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "By intentionally embedding select human cognitive biases into language models, we can improve their ability to interact with users more naturally and resolve tasks that require intuitive decision-making.",
        "Related Work": "Mindful Mimicry diverges from traditional approaches in AI research by embracing rather than avoiding the introduction of certain human cognitive biases. Unlike MetaPrompting which focuses on self-reflexive mechanisms, or ReAct's interleaving reasoning with actions, Mindful Mimicry seeks to understand and replicate specific biases that facilitate effective communication and problem-solving, such as framing effects in decision-making or anchoring in negotiation tasks.",
        "Abstract": "This proposal introduces Mindful Mimicry, a novel approach to language model development where we purposefully integrate select human cognitive biases into the model's reasoning framework. The goal is twofold: first, to enable more natural and intuitive interactions with users by mirroring their thought processes; second, to enhance task resolution in scenarios that benefit from heuristic decision-making, such as creative problem-solving or dynamic negotiation tasks. By conducting a series of controlled experiments, we aim to demonstrate how mindful mimicry can lead to improved performance on benchmarks like the Winograd Schema Challenge for commonsense reasoning and the Negotiation Corpus for dialogue systems.",

        "Abstract": "This proposal introduces Symbiotic Reasoning, an innovative approach that harnesses the complementary capabilities of AI language models and human expertise. The core idea is to establish a co-evolutionary loop where prompts are not static but evolve based on feedback and insights from both AI and humans during problem-solving sessions. This dynamic interplay aims to refine reasoning strategies, enhance decision-making accuracy, and improve outcomes in complex tasks such as medical diagnosis, legal case analysis, or strategic planning scenarios.

The hypothesis is that by providing a richer toolkit of cognitive perspectives, language models can better navigate nuances in user interactions, interpret specialized knowledge, and deliver more accurate responses tailored to specific domains.
