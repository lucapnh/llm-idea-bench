        "Title": "Fusing Descriptor Spaces for Enhanced Interatomic Potential Models in Gaussian Processes",
        "Short Hypothesis": "The integration of multiple descriptor spaces within a single Gaussian Process framework can lead to improved accuracy and generalization capabilities for interatomic potential models, by capturing complementary aspects of atomic interactions.",
        "Related Work": "While the GAP framework has been successful with descriptors like SOAP, there is limited research on combining different descriptors within a unified GP model. This proposal builds upon the existing literature by introducing a method to fuse various descriptor spaces (e.g., SOAP, pair potentials) into a single interatomic potential model.",
        "Abstract": "This study proposes an innovative approach in the Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAP) framework by fusing multiple descriptor spaces within a unified Gaussian Process (GP). By integrating descriptors such as Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), pair potentials, and other relevant features, we aim to capture a broader spectrum of atomic interactions. This fusion is expected to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities across diverse materials systems. We will develop a novel covariance function that effectively merges these descriptor spaces while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed methodology will be validated using benchmark datasets from quantum-mechanical calculations, with an emphasis on its performance in predicting total energies and forces for unseen atomic configurations.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "The incorporation of multiscale descriptors within the Gaussian Process framework can significantly improve the accuracy and transferability of interatomic potential models by capturing both local and non-local interactions across different length scales.",
        "Related Work": "Existing GAP frameworks primarily focus on local descriptors such as SOAP to model atomic environments. This proposal diverges from current approaches by introducing a novel method that integrates multiscale descriptors, allowing for the simultaneous modeling of short-range (e.g., covalent bonding) and long-range (e.g., van der Waals interactions) phenomena within a unified Gaussian Process model.",
        "Abstract": "This study pioneers an innovative approach in the Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAP) framework by incorporating multiscale descriptors to capture both local and non-local atomic interactions across various length scales. By integrating short-range descriptors like SOAP with long-range descriptors that account for van der Waals forces, we aim to enhance the model's accuracy and transferability in predicting complex material behaviors. We will develop a novel Gaussian Process formulation capable of learning from multiscale data sources while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed methodology will be rigorously tested on diverse materials systems using QUIP, with validation metrics including energy predictions, force calculations, and structural stability assessments for both local and extended atomic configurations.",
