        "Short Hypothesis": "By incorporating hierarchical planning into the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, large language models can more effectively navigate complex decision trees and improve their problem-solving capabilities across a broader range of tasks.",
        "Related Work": "The ToT framework has shown promise in enhancing LLMs' ability to explore multiple reasoning paths. However, it primarily focuses on local branching and global planning without explicitly addressing the hierarchy of decisions. Our proposal builds upon this by introducing a hierarchical planning component that allows for more structured decision-making at different levels of abstraction.",
        "Abstract": "This paper introduces 'LLMPlanner', an extension to the Tree of Thoughts framework, which integrates hierarchical planning into large language models (LLMs) for improved problem-solving. LLMPlanner decomposes complex tasks into a hierarchy of sub-tasks and utilizes LLMs to generate plans at each level, guiding the search process more effectively. By doing so, it allows for a systematic exploration of decision spaces, with higher levels focusing on broad strategies and lower levels detailing specific actions. We hypothesize that this approach will enhance the interpretability and success rate of LLMs in tasks requiring complex planning, such as strategic games or project management scenarios. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMPlanner through experiments on a diverse set of problems designed to test hierarchical decision-making capabilities.",
