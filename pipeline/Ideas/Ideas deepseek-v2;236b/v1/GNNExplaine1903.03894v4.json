        "Short Hypothesis": "The identification of exemplar substructures within graph datasets can significantly improve the interpretability of GNN predictions by serving as recognizable and representative patterns.",
        "Related Work": "While existing methods like GNNExplainer focus on explaining individual predictions, our proposal aims to identify common substructures across instances that are indicative of certain classes or behaviors. This extends beyond single-instance explanations to provide a broader understanding of the model's decision process.",
        "Abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various domains but often lack transparency due to their complex interplay between graph structure and node features. GNNExemplar is proposed as an innovative approach to enhance interpretability by discovering and utilizing exemplar substructures that are representative of key classes or patterns within the dataset. By employing a clustering-based technique on subgraphs extracted from GNNExplainer's explanations, we identify recurring motifs that serve as 'exemplars' for each class. These exemplars not only provide an intuitive understanding of what the model has learned but also offer a means to validate and compare different GNNs by their ability to capture these salient substructures. Our method is evaluated on both synthetic datasets with known ground-truth structures, such as BA-Shapes and Tree-Cycles, and real-world datasets like MUTAG and Reddit threads, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing meaningful patterns that align with domain knowledge.",

GNNInsights proposes an innovative framework that leverages causal inference techniques to identify these underlying biases in GNN models and provide interpretable explanations for why certain predictions may be unfair or skewed towards particular graph structures. By applying counterfactual analysis and intervention-based methods, we can quantify the impact of various subgraph configurations on model outcomes and isolate the true causal relationships from spurious correlations. This approach not only enhances the interpretability of GNNs by revealing the actual drivers of predictions but also paves the way for developing debiasing strategies to ensure fair decision-making across diverse graph datasets. We will validate our method using synthetic datasets with known bias patterns, such as those exhibiting community segregation or imbalanced feature distributions, and real-world datasets where fairness is a critical concern, like social network analysis or credit scoring applications.",
