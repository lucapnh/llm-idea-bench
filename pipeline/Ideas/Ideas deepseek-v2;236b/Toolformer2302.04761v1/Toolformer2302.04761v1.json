        "Short Hypothesis": "A reinforcement learning approach can effectively train language models to autonomously chain tools, significantly improving their problem-solving capabilities across diverse tasks.",
        "Related Work": "Existing literature on integrating external tools with language models (e.g., Toolformer) focuses on single-tool invocation. Our proposal introduces a novel method for the model to learn multi-tool chaining through reinforcement learning, which is not covered in current research.",
        "Abstract": "To enhance the problem-solving abilities of language models across complex tasks, we propose AutoToolchain, an approach that leverages reinforcement learning to enable efficient tool chaining. Our model learns to select and chain tools by proposing candidate sequences within pretraining data, evaluating their effectiveness using a task-specific scoring function, and retaining those that improve performance. This is achieved through a self-supervised training phase where the model interacts with a diverse set of APIs in an environment designed to simulate real-world problem-solving scenarios. Empirical studies on various benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in tasks requiring sequential tool use, such as complex mathematical reasoning or multi-lingual information retrieval.",

By leveraging feedback from initial tool invocations, the model learns to adapt its strategies through a reward mechanism designed to promote efficient API usage and accurate task completion. This process allows for continuous improvement in problem-solving capabilities across a wide range of tasks that require dynamic interaction with external resources. We will evaluate IterativeAPIRefiner on benchmarks including complex mathematical problems, real-time information retrieval, and Q&A scenarios where iterative refinement is crucial.",
