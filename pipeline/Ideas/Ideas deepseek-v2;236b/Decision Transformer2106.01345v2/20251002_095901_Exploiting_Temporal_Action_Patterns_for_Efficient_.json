Omor Faruk, Zejian Zhou. arXiv.org, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Agent-based Transformers have been widely adopted in recent reinforcement learning advances due to their demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks. However, the high computational complexity of Transformers often results in significant energy consumption, limiting their deployment in real-world autonomous systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their biologically inspired structure, offer an energy-efficient alternative for machine learning. In this paper, a novel Spike-Transformer Reinforcement Learning (STRL) algorithm that combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the powerful decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning is developed. Specifically, an SNN using multi-step Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and attention mechanisms capable of processing spatio-temporal patterns over multiple time steps is designed. The architecture is further enhanced with state, action, and reward encodings to create a Transformer-like structure optimized for reinforcement learning tasks. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed SNN Transformer achieves significantly improved policy performance compared to conventional agent-based Transformers. With both enhanced energy efficiency and policy optimality, this work highlights a promising direction for deploying bio-inspired, low-cost machine learning models in complex real-world decision-making scenarios.",

Chengyu Wang, Luhan Wang, Zhaoming Lu, Celimuge Wu, Guochu Shou, Xiangming Wen. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Developing trustworthy reinforcement learning (RL) agents for safety-critical control tasks, such as end-to-end autonomous driving, has been a longstanding challenge due to low sample efficiency. Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by performing self-supervised auxiliary tasks like self-reconstruction or predicting long-term future states. However, there still remain unexplored sequential features and causality relationships inherent in sequential state, action, and reward signals in the frequency domain. To fully exploit the temporal and frequential features, we propose a contrastive RL framework called brain-inspired causality-aware contrastive learning (BRYANT) to achieve efficient representation learning and human-like autonomous driving. Different from existing temporal predictive methods, we transform the sequential latent representations, reward, and action signals into the frequency domain, followed by the symmetric temporal prediction pattern for real and imaginary parts of the frequential signals. To capture the temporal causality for the latent representations, we introduce a brain-inspired network structure called Closed-form Continuous-time (CfC) network to parameterize the derivative of the latent representations and establish the neural dynamic model. Experimental results conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of BRYANT in efficient representation learning, enabling agents to concentrate on potential risks and decrease the collision rate compared to several state-of-the-art RL methods. Furthermore, through the visualization of the latent representation prediction process, we reveal the causal relationships between the critic Q values and the latent representation vectors in the frequency domain, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the frequency-domain prediction.",

IEEE Access, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The sophistication of Android malware poses significant threats to user security and privacy. Traditional detection methods struggle with rapid malware evolution and benign application diversity, leading to high false positive rates and limited adaptability. This paper introduces a hybrid methodology leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and adaptability in Android malware detection. It begins with collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive dataset of benign and malicious applications. An efficient Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is employed to generate synthetic malware samples, effectively augmenting the dataset and enhancing the diversity of the malware samples under study process. To model the intricate relationships between applications, an efficient Graph Neural Network (GNN) process is utilized. Incorporating transformers, sequences of system and API calls are analyzed, harnessing this ability to discern patterns indicative of malicious activities. Additionally, a one-shot learning model tailored for the detection of new malware variants with minimal examples is introduced, enabling rapid adaptation to emerging threats. Federated learning preserves user privacy by training the model across a distributed network. A reinforcement learning model initiates proactive defenses, identifying optimal actions against malware threats. This methodology advances Android malware detection, showing over 5.9% improvement in detection accuracy, 4.5% reduction in false positives, and enhanced adaptability to new malware variants. It ensures enhanced security for Android users while preserving privacy. Evaluation results highlight its practical applicability in real-time scenarios.",

World Journal of Advanced Engineering Technology and Sciences, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Phishing attacks are major threats to email security and pose challenges, while cyber attackers utilize increasingly sophisticated means to deceive the user and steal away important information. Well-established ways of detecting phishing attacks, such as rule-based systems or simple machine-learning models, usually cannot deal efficiently with such advanced threats. This research proposes an approach to detect phishing attacks on email systems, which deploys natural language processing and deep learning technologies. The method proposes to improve the detection accuracies and efficiencies of phishing emails, which consequently enhances the protection of emails against popular cyberattack attempts and aids in securing users from such attacks.\nThe research involves designing an active model that utilizes the strength of NLP-based text analysis for DL-oriented pattern identification. The NLP techniques used in this study include tokenization, stop-word removal, and context-based analysis to extract significant features from the email messages. Such context information greatly helps this model differentiate between actual emails and phishing ones. Deep learning algorithms exploited here are based on CNN and LSTM networks, offering sinusoidally varying parameters for optimum recognition of patterns from different perspectives in the email data's spatial and temporal domains. The experiment results validated that the hybrid model was far superior to the conventional methods in robbing phish attack detection. The model stood at an accuracy of 97.5%, much ahead of the baseline models purely having rule-based systems or traditional machine learning algorithms. The model also performed well under real-time detection conditions, with low latency and high throughput support for deployment in an active email environment. Evidence of the model's capability to sense new variants of future phishing threats also came in the automatic updating and continuous learning, thus making it applicable to newly emerging threats. The study's practical implications are numerous in providing advances in email protection. Companies can use the model to ward off phishing attacks with reduced chances of data breaches and financial loss. Due to its low cost and scalable features, this solution can be used in organizations from small- and medium-sized to large enterprise levels. The improved detection of phishing attacks brings organizations closer to compliance with data protection and cybersecurity regulations, thus minimizing their chances of noncompliance and the fines that come with it. Future research paths include exploring even newer NLP methods consisting of transformer-based models for feature extraction about contextual understanding. Exploring hybrid approaches that can merge DL with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning in ML, will create a more robust and adaptive phishing filter. Future fields for research are multimodal data, that is, a mixture of email metadata and behavior. Merely considering hybrid techniques merging artificial intelligence with machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning can generate an even more robust and adaptive phishing filter. Coupling all these technical solutions with user awareness and education programs would greatly enhance overall security.",
