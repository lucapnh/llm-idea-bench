        "Short Hypothesis": "AI-driven healthcare assistants can significantly improve patient care by adapting to individual medical scenarios and providing contextually relevant recommendations.",
        "Related Work": "The proposal distinguishes itself from related works like 'clickBrick Prompt Engineering' (Verhees et al., 2025) which focuses on clinical psychiatry, and 'ElderEase AR' (Song et al., 2024) that targets elderly support. Our approach is more general, aiming to enhance healthcare assistance across various medical domains using an adaptive response integration framework.",
        "Abstract": "The rapid advancement of AI in healthcare has led to the development of numerous applications aimed at improving patient care. However, achieving a high level of personalization and context-awareness remains challenging. This proposal introduces the Adaptive Response Integration Approach (ARIA), a novel framework designed to enhance AI assistants' ability to provide tailored recommendations across diverse medical scenarios. ARIA leverages large language models and prompt engineering techniques to adapt responses based on patient data, clinical guidelines, and real-time feedback from healthcare professionals. We hypothesize that by integrating these elements, we can create more effective and adaptive AI systems for healthcare assistance. The proposed experiments will evaluate the efficacy of ARIA in various medical scenarios and compare its performance with existing AI assistants.",

This proposal introduces REASONAID, an innovative framework that leverages advanced reasoning techniques within AI systems to sequence actions tailored to specific medical scenarios. By employing LLMs and incorporating domain-specific knowledge bases, REASONAID aims to enhance decision-making processes in healthcare by providing a structured approach to diagnosis and treatment plan generation.
