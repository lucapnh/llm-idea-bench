Ekbrand, S. Davia, Adel Daoud. PLoS ONE, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 22\nAbstract: Nigeria is one of the fastest growing African economies, yet struggles with armed conflict, poverty, and morbidity. An area of high concern is how this situation affects vulnerable families and their children. A key pathway in improving the situation for children in times of conflict is to reinforce maternal agency, for instance, through education. However, the state of the art of research lacks a clear understanding of how many years of education is needed before children benefit. Due to mother\u2019s differing social context and ability, the effect of maternal education varies. We study the heterogeneous treatment effects of maternal agency, here operationalized as length of education, on severe child undernutrition in the context of armed conflict. We deploy a repeated cross-sectional study design, using the Nigeria 2008 and 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The sample covers 25,917 children and their respective mothers. A key methodological challenge is to estimate this heterogeneity inductively. The causal inference literature proposes a machine learning approach, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), as a promising avenue to overcome this challenge. Based on BART-estimation of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) this study confirms earlier findings in that maternal education decreases severe child undernutrition, but only when mothers acquire an education that lasts more than the country\u2019s compulsory 9 years; that is 10 years of education and higher. This protective effect remains even during the exposure of armed conflict.",

Annals of Applied Statistics, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 16\nAbstract: Assessing heterogeneity in the effects of treatments has become increasingly popular in the field of causal inference and carries important implications for clinical decision-making. While extensive literature exists for studying treatment effect heterogeneity when outcomes are fully observed, there has been limited development in tools for estimating heterogeneous causal effects when patient-centered outcomes are truncated by a terminal event, such as death. Due to mortality occurring during study follow-up, the outcomes of interest are unobservable, undefined, or not fully observed for many participants in which case principal stratification is an appealing framework to draw valid causal conclusions. Motivated by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network (ARDSNetwork) ARDS respiratory management (ARMA) trial, we developed a flexible Bayesian machine learning approach to estimate the average causal effect and heterogeneous causal effects among the always-survivors stratum when clinical outcomes are subject to truncation. We adopted Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to flexibly specify separate mean models for the potential outcomes and latent stratum membership. In the analysis of the ARMA trial, we found that the low tidal volume treatment had an overall benefit for participants sustaining acute lung injuries on the outcome of time to returning home but substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects among the always-survivors, driven most strongly by biologic sex and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient at baseline (a physiologic measure of lung function and degree of hypoxemia). These findings illustrate how the proposed methodology could guide the prognostic enrichment of future trials in the field.",

        "4": "Distilling heterogeneous treatment effects: Stable subgroup estimation in causal inference. Melody Huang, Tiffany M Tang, Ana M. Kenney. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Recent methodological developments have introduced new black-box approaches to better estimate heterogeneous treatment effects; however, these methods fall short of providing interpretable characterizations of the underlying individuals who may be most at risk or benefit most from receiving the treatment, thereby limiting their practical utility. In this work, we introduce \\textit{causal distillation trees} (CDT) to estimate interpretable subgroups. CDT allows researchers to fit any machine learning model to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effect, and then leverages a simple, second-stage tree-based model to\"distill\"the estimated treatment effect into meaningful subgroups. As a result, CDT inherits the improvements in predictive performance from black-box machine learning models while preserving the interpretability of a simple decision tree. We derive theoretical guarantees for the consistency of the estimated subgroups using CDT, and introduce stability-driven diagnostics for researchers to evaluate the quality of the estimated subgroups. We illustrate our proposed method on a randomized controlled trial of antiretroviral treatment for HIV from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175 and show that CDT out-performs state-of-the-art approaches in constructing stable, clinically relevant subgroups.",

The Journal of Financial Data Science, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Making reliable causal inferences is integral to both explaining past events and forecasting the future. Although there are various theories of economic causality, there has not yet been a wide adoption of machine learning techniques for causal inference within finance. One recently developed framework, double machine learning, is an approach to causal inference that is specifically designed to correct for bias in statistical analysis. In doing so, it allows for a more precise evaluation of treatment effects in the presence of confounders. In this article, the author uses double machine learning to study market contagion. He considers the treatment variable to be the weekly return of the S&P 500 Index below a specific threshold and the outcome to be the weekly return in a single major non-US market. In analyzing each non-US market, the other non-US markets under consideration are used as confounders. The author presents two case studies. In the first, outcomes are observed in the same week as the treatment is observed and, in the second, in the week after. His results show that, in the first case study, sizable and statistically significant contagion effects are observed but somewhat diluted due to the presence of confounders. In contrast, in the second case study, more ambiguous contagion effects are observed and the level of statistical significance is measurably lower than those observed in the first case study, indicating that contagion effects are most clearly transmitted in the same week that the dislocation in the S&P 500 occurs.",

Yile Yu, Anzhi Xu. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: In response to the increasing complexity of policy environments and the proliferation of high-dimensional data, this paper introduces the S-DIDML estimator a framework grounded in structure and semiparametrically flexible for causal inference. By embedding Difference-in-Differences (DID) logic within a Double Machine Learning (DML) architecture, the S-DIDML approach combines the strengths of temporal identification, machine learning-based nuisance adjustment, and orthogonalized estimation. We begin by identifying critical limitations in existing methods, including the lack of structural interpretability in ML models, instability of classical DID under high-dimensional confounding, and the temporal rigidity of standard DML frameworks. Building on recent advances in staggered adoption designs and Neyman orthogonalization, S-DIDML offers a five-step estimation pipeline that enables robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) while maintaining interpretability and scalability. Demonstrative applications are discussed across labor economics, education, taxation, and environmental policy. The proposed framework contributes to the methodological frontier by offering a blueprint for policy-relevant, structurally interpretable, and statistically valid causal analysis in complex data settings.",

Journal of Research in Science and Engineering, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: In the realm of econometrics, the estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) has traditionally dominated causal inference, often oversimplifying the complex, heterogeneous nature of individual responses to interventions. This study introduces a nuanced approach, \"Beyond the Average: Personalized Causal Inference in Econometrics with Machine Learning, \" which leverages advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to shift the focus towards personalized causal effects (PCE), thereby uncovering the variability in treatment effects across individuals. Utilizing a synthetic dataset designed to reflect realistic economic behaviors and responses, we employed Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Causal Forests among other ML techniques to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATE), providing insights into the heterogeneity of treatment impacts. Our methodology encompassed comprehensive data preprocessing, feature selection based on economic theory and ML insights, and rigorous model validation processes. The results reveal significant heterogeneity in treatment effects, challenging the conventional reliance on ATE and highlighting the importance of considering individual characteristics in policy design and evaluation. Specifically, younger individuals and those with lower income and education levels exhibited markedly different responses to the financial literacy intervention, suggesting that personalized approaches could significantly enhance the effectiveness of such programs. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility and value of applying ML to econometric analysis for personalized causal inference but also lays the groundwork for future research aimed at integrating these methodologies into practical policy - making. By moving beyond the average and embracing the complexity of individual differences, econometric analysis can offer more targeted, effective, and equitable solutions to societal challenges.",

Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Treatment effect heterogeneity plays an important role in many areas of causal inference, and in recent years, estimation of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) has received much attention in the statistical community. While accurate estimation of the CATE\u2010function through flexible machine learning procedures provides a tool for prediction of the individual treatment effect, it does not provide further insight into the driving features of potential treatment effect heterogeneity. Recent papers have addressed this problem by providing variable importance measures for treatment effect heterogeneity. Most of the suggestions have been developed for continuous or binary outcome, while little attention has been given to censored time\u2010to\u2010event outcome. In this paper, we extend the treatment effect variable importance measure (TE\u2010VIM) proposed in Hines, Diaz\u2010Ordaz, and Vansteelandt (2022a) to the survival setting with censored outcome. We derive an estimator for the TE\u2010VIM for two different CATE functions based on the survival function and RMST, respectively. Along with the TE\u2010VIM, we propose a new measure of treatment effect heterogeneity based on the best partially linear projection of the CATE and suggest accompanying estimators for that projection. All estimators are based on semiparametric efficiency theory, and we give conditions under which they are asymptotically linear. The finite\u2010sample performance of the derived estimators is investigated through a simulation study. Finally, the estimators are applied and contrasted in two real data examples.",
        "10": "Green Transformation and New Quality Productivity: A Triple Difference Approach with Double Machine Learning. Hongyuan Wang. Wireless and Optical Communications Conference, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: This paper proposes an integrated causal inference framework combining triple difference (DDD) and double machine learning (DML) to evaluate the impact of green technological innovation on new quality productivity growth. Grounded in Porter's hypothesis and technological innovation theory, the study addresses key challenges in environmental policy evaluation by merging quasi-experimental designs with machine learning techniques. The methodology employs propensity score matching to construct comparable treatment and control groups, followed by DDD estimation to identify causal effects across multiple dimensions, while leveraging DML to control for high-dimensional co-founders and uncover heterogeneous treatment effects. Focusing on China's manufacturing sector, the analysis demonstrates that green technology adoption significantly enhances productivity, with substantial variation across firm ownership structures and regional characteristics. The methodological contribution lies in demonstrating how machine learning augments traditional difference-in-differences approaches through improved covariate balancing, detection of nonlinear treatment effects, and refined subgroup analysis. The findings offer theoretical insights into the mechanisms of green productivity growth and provide empirical evidence for policymakers to design targeted environmental innovation strategies."
