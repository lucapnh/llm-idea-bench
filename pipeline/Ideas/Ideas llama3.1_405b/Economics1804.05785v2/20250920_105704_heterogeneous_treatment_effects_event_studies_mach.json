        "1": "SurvITE: Learning Heterogeneous Treatment Effects from Time-to-Event Data. Alicia Curth, Changhee Lee, M. Schaar. Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 31\nAbstract: We study the problem of inferring heterogeneous treatment effects from time-to-event data. While both the related problems of (i) estimating treatment effects for binary or continuous outcomes and (ii) predicting survival outcomes have been well studied in the recent machine learning literature, their combination -- albeit of high practical relevance -- has received considerably less attention. With the ultimate goal of reliably estimating the effects of treatments on instantaneous risk and survival probabilities, we focus on the problem of learning (discrete-time) treatment-specific conditional hazard functions. We find that unique challenges arise in this context due to a variety of covariate shift issues that go beyond a mere combination of well-studied confounding and censoring biases. We theoretically analyse their effects by adapting recent generalization bounds from domain adaptation and treatment effect estimation to our setting and discuss implications for model design. We use the resulting insights to propose a novel deep learning method for treatment-specific hazard estimation based on balancing representations. We investigate performance across a range of experimental settings and empirically confirm that our method outperforms baselines by addressing covariate shifts from various sources.",

Shuang Li, Ziyuan Pu, Zhiyong Cui, Seunghyeon Lee, Xiucheng Guo, D. Ngoduy. Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 15\nAbstract: Highway traffic crashes exert a considerable impact on both transportation systems and the economy. In this context, accurate and dependable emergency responses are crucial for effective traffic management. However, the influence of crashes on traffic status varies across diverse factors and may be biased due to selection bias. Therefore, there arises a necessity to accurately estimate the heterogeneous causal effects of crashes, thereby providing essential insights to facilitate individual-level emergency decision-making. This paper proposes a novel causal machine learning framework to estimate the causal effect of different types of crashes on highway speed. The Neyman-Rubin Causal Model (RCM) is employed to formulate this problem from a causal perspective. The Conditional Shapley Value Index (CSVI) is proposed based on causal graph theory to filter adverse variables, and the Structural Causal Model (SCM) is then adopted to define the statistical estimand for causal effects. The treatment effects are estimated by Doubly Robust Learning (DRL) methods, which combine doubly robust causal inference with classification and regression machine learning models. Experimental results from 4815 crashes on Highway Interstate 5 in Washington State reveal the heterogeneous treatment effects of crashes at varying distances and durations. The rear-end crashes cause more severe congestion and longer durations than other types of crashes, and the sideswipe crashes have the longest delayed impact. Additionally, the findings show that rear-end crashes affect traffic greater at night, while crash to objects has the most significant influence during peak hours. Statistical hypothesis tests, error metrics based on matched\"counterfactual outcomes\", and sensitive analyses are employed for assessment, and the results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.",

Journal of Geographical Systems, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 11\nAbstract: The development of the \u201ccausal\u201d forest by Wager and Athey (J Am Stat Assoc 113(523): 1228\u20131242, 2018 ) represents a significant advance in the area of explanatory/causal machine learning. However, this approach has not yet been widely applied to geographically referenced data, which present some unique issues: the random split of the test and training sets in the typical causal forest design fractures the spatial fabric of geographic data. To help solve this issue, we use a simulated dataset with known properties for average treatment effects and conditional average treatment effects to compare the performance of CF models across different definitions of the test/train split. We also develop a new \u201cspatial\u201d T-learner that can be implemented using predictive methods like random forest to provide estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects across all units. Our results show that all of the machine learning models outperform traditional ordinary least squares regression at identifying the true average treatment effect, but are not significantly different from one another. We then apply the preferred causal forest model in the context of analysing the treatment effect of the construction of the Valley Metro light rail (tram) system on on-road CO_2 emissions per capita at the block group level in Maricopa County, Arizona, and find that the neighbourhoods most likely to benefit from treatment are those with higher pre-treatment proportions of transit and pedestrian commuting and lower proportions of auto commuting.",

Parmigiani. , 2023.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) is crucial for precision medicine. While multiple studies can improve the generalizability of results, leveraging them for estimation is statistically challenging. Existing approaches often assume identical HTEs across studies, but this may be violated due to various sources of between-study heterogeneity, including differences in study design, study populations, and data collection protocols, among others. To this end, we propose a framework for multi-study HTE estimation that accounts for between-study heterogeneity in the nuisance functions and treatment effects. Our approach, the multi-study R-learner, extends the R-learner to obtain principled statistical estimation with machine learning (ML) in the multi-study setting. It involves a data-adaptive objective function that links study-specific treatment effects with nuisance functions through membership probabilities, which enable information to be borrowed across potentially heterogeneous studies. The multi-study R-learner framework can combine data from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or a combination of both. It's easy to implement and flexible in its ability to incorporate ML for estimating HTEs, nuisance functions, and membership probabilities. In the series estimation framework, we show that the multi-study R-learner is asymptotically normal and more efficient than the R-learner when there is between-study heterogeneity in the propensity score model under homoscedasticity. We illustrate using cancer data that the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing approaches in the presence of between-study heterogeneity.",
        "7": "Orthogonal Survival Learners for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects from Time-to-Event Data. Dennis Frauen, Maresa Schr\u00f6der, Konstantin Hess, Stefan Feuerriegel. arXiv.org, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) is crucial for personalized decision-making. However, this task is challenging in survival analysis, which includes time-to-event data with censored outcomes (e.g., due to study dropout). In this paper, we propose a toolbox of novel orthogonal survival learners to estimate HTEs from time-to-event data under censoring. Our learners have three main advantages: (i) we show that learners from our toolbox are guaranteed to be orthogonal and thus come with favorable theoretical properties; (ii) our toolbox allows for incorporating a custom weighting function, which can lead to robustness against different types of low overlap, and (iii) our learners are model-agnostic (i.e., they can be combined with arbitrary machine learning models). We instantiate the learners from our toolbox using several weighting functions and, as a result, propose various neural orthogonal survival learners. Some of these coincide with existing survival learners (including survival versions of the DR- and R-learner), while others are novel and further robust w.r.t. low overlap regimes specific to the survival setting (i.e., survival overlap and censoring overlap). We then empirically verify the effectiveness of our learners for HTE estimation in different low-overlap regimes through numerical experiments. In sum, we provide practitioners with a large toolbox of learners that can be used for randomized and observational studies with censored time-to-event data.",

Biometrics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: When estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, missing outcome data can complicate treatment effect estimation, causing certain subgroups of the population to be poorly represented. In this work, we discuss this commonly overlooked problem and consider the impact that missing at random outcome data has on causal machine learning estimators for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). We propose 2 de-biased machine learning estimators for the CATE, the mDR-learner, and mEP-learner, which address the issue of under-representation by integrating inverse probability of censoring weights into the DR-learner and EP-learner, respectively. We show that under reasonable conditions, these estimators are oracle efficient and illustrate their favorable performance through simulated data settings, comparing them to existing CATE estimators, including comparison to estimators that use common missing data techniques. We present an example of their application using the GBSG2 trial, exploring treatment effect heterogeneity when comparing hormonal therapies to non-hormonal therapies among breast cancer patients post surgery, and offer guidance on the decisions a practitioner must make when implementing these estimators.",

Gilbert, Benjamin W. Domingue. 2024 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC), 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Educational interventions are typically evaluated using traditional statistical methods focusing on overall test scores. Such evaluations may miss item-level effects. This work explores the use of machine learning (ML) to analyze item-level heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE). Such approaches may allow for more personalized educational assistance. We compared robust ML approaches such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors to a traditional explanatory item response model (EIRM) approach and found that ML approaches yield higher accuracy. Our results suggest that flexible models accounting for item-specific treatment effects have important predictive utility in educational interventions."
