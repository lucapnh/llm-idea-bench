        "1": "Estimating Dynamic Treatment Effects in Event Studies With Heterogeneous Treatment Effects. S. Abraham, Liyang Sun. Journal of Econometrics, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 2823\nAbstract: Event studies are frequently used to estimate average treatment effects on the treated (ATT). In estimating the ATT, researchers commonly use fixed effects models that implicitly assume constant treatment effects across cohorts. We show that this is not an innocuous assumption. In fixed effect models where the sole regressor is treatment status, the OLS coefficient is a non-convex average of the heterogeneous cohort-specific ATTs. When regressors containing lags and leads of treatment are added, the OLS coefficient corresponding to a given lead or lag picks up spurious terms consisting of treatment effects from other periods. Therefore, estimates from these commonly used models are not causally interpretable. We propose alternative estimators that identify certain convex averages of the cohort-specific ATTs, hence allowing for causal interpretation even under heterogeneous treatment effects. To illustrate the empirical content of our results, we show that the fixed effects estimators and our proposed estimators differ substantially in an application to the economic consequences of hospitalization.",

Qi Huang, Xiantong Zou, Edward J. Boyko, Linong Ji. Diabetes, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Evaluating cardiovascular risks and choosing the right pharmacotherapy is crucial for personalized treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our study aims to dynamically estimate cardiovascular risks in patients with type 2 diabetes and predict their heterogeneous treatment responses to canagliflozin. We employed data from ACCORD and CANVAS for model derivation and CANVAS-R and CREDENCE for external tests. The ML-CVD model used baseline clinical features and interim factors to predict 4-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). ML-HF for heart failure were also developed. Complication-specific XGBoost survival models were applied. Our model included 13,961 patients for development and 9,609 for testing. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ML-CVD to predict MACE was 0.75 (95%CI 0.71-0.78) in the testing cohort of ACCORD and CANVAS, 0.75 (0.65-0.84) in CREDENCE, and 0.71 (0.65-0.76) in CANVAS-R. This model outperformed traditional models Framingham, ASCVD, ADVANCE, and model using only baseline features (ML-CVD (base)). ML-CVD more effectively distinguished the cardiovascular risk reduction between canagliflozin and placebo in patients with higher baseline risks. Patients who were treated with canagliflozin and showed a greater risk reduction than the median of the placebo group at one year, as predicted by ML-CVD, were identified as \"SGLT2i responders.\" Those who did not meet this criterion were labeled as 'non-responders'. The actual hazard ratio (HR) for MACE, assessed by Cox regression, significantly decreased in SGLT2i responders compared to non-responders in both derivation and testing cohorts (p-values: CANVAS <0.001, CREDENCE 0.03, CANVAS-R 0.004). Applying ML-HF showed comparable effects on heart failure outcomes, respectively. Machine-learning models for dynamic cardiovascular outcome prediction yield innovative strategies for risk assessment and drug response identification.\n \n \n Q. Huang: None. X. Zou: None. E.J.
