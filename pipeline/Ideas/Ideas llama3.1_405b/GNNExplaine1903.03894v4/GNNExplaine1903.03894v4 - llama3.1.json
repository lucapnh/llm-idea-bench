        "Related Work": "Existing GNN explainability methods are limited by their reliance on predefined concepts, instance-specific explanations, or strict prerequisites. Our approach addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework that extracts interpretable logic rules from GNNs in a model-agnostic and data-driven manner.",

We propose LOGICXGNN, a novel framework for extracting interpretable logic rules from GNNs without relying on predefined concepts. Our approach is model-agnostic, efficient, and data-driven, facilitating knowledge discovery and offering significant potential for applications such as drug design.",
