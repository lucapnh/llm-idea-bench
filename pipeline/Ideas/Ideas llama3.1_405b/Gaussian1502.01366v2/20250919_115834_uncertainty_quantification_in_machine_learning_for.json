Scientific Reports, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 26\nAbstract: With the increased use of data-driven approaches and machine learning-based methods in material science, the importance of reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the predicted variables for informed decision-making cannot be overstated. UQ in material property prediction poses unique challenges, including multi-scale and multi-physics nature of materials, intricate interactions between numerous factors, limited availability of large curated datasets, etc. In this work, we introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) approach for UQ, which integrates knowledge from governing laws in materials to guide the models toward physically consistent predictions. To evaluate the approach, we present case studies for predicting the creep rupture life of steel alloys. Experimental validation with three datasets of creep tests demonstrates that this method produces point predictions and uncertainty estimations that are competitive or exceed the performance of conventional UQ methods such as Gaussian Process Regression. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of employing UQ in an active learning scenario and report competitive performance. The most promising framework for creep life prediction is BNNs based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior distribution of network parameters, as it provided more reliable results in comparison to BNNs based on variational inference approximation or related NNs with probabilistic outputs.",

Reviews in chemical engineering, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 8\nAbstract: Abstract Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences. In general, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt to learn essential physics and chemistry from large amounts of data. The reliability of predictions, however, is often not guaranteed, particularly for out-of-distribution data, due to the limited physical or chemical principles in the functional form. Therefore, it is critical to quantify the uncertainty in ML predictions and understand its propagation to downstream chemical and materials applications. This review examines existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) and uncertainty propagation (UP) methods for atomistic ML under the framework of probabilistic modeling. We first categorize the UQ methods and explain the similarities and differences among them. Following this, performance metrics for evaluating their accuracy, precision, calibration, and efficiency are presented, along with techniques for recalibration. These metrics are then applied to survey existing UQ benchmark studies that use molecular and materials datasets. Furthermore, we discuss UP methods to propagate uncertainty in widely used materials and chemical simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We conclude with remarks on the challenges and opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.",

Desy. , 2024.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: In deep-inelastic positron-proton scattering, the lepton-jet azimuthal angular asymmetry is measured using data collected with the H1 detector at HERA. When the average transverse momentum of the lepton-jet system, $\\lvert \\vec{P}_\\perp \\rvert $, is much larger than the total transverse momentum of the system, $\\lvert \\vec{q}_\\perp \\rvert$, the asymmetry between parallel and antiparallel configurations, $\\vec{P}_\\perp$ and $\\vec{q}_\\perp$, is expected to be generated by initial and final state soft gluon radiation and can be predicted using perturbation theory. Quantifying the angular properties of the asymmetry therefore provides an additional test of the strong force. Studying the asymmetry is important for future measurements of intrinsic asymmetries generated by the proton's constituents through Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), where this asymmetry constitutes a dominant background. Moments of the azimuthal asymmetries are measured using a machine learning method for unfolding that does not require binning.",

        "6": "Navigating Small Datasets with Machine Learning: Gaussian Process Modeling for Colloidal Gelation.. Rohan Batra, Yogesh M Joshi, Sachin Shanbhag. Langmuir, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Small datasets, which are common in many traditional science and engineering disciplines, present a challenge for powerful machine learning methods that are better suited for large datasets. Through the example of spontaneous colloidal sol-gel transition, we present a data-driven framework based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) for modeling and inference with limited data. GPs are well-suited for small datasets and automatically provide uncertainty quantification for model predictions. We explore GPs with two different structures (single and multi-output) to map synthesis parameters to gelation characteristics. While both GP structures quantitatively capture the relationships between the input and output variables, we favor multioutput GP, which attempts to simultaneously learn correlations between different outputs, due to its superior uncertainty calibration. To address inverse problems, we introduce a Bayesian framework that embeds a GP model into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. It enables the discovery of multiple synthesis pathways for achieving desired material properties. Therefore, this work presents a robust methodology for data-constrained modeling, with broad applicability to material design in general and the colloidal domain in particular.",
