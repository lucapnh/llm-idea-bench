        "1": "Machine Learning a General-Purpose Interatomic Potential for Silicon. A. Bart\u00f3k, J. Kermode, N. Bernstein, G\u00e1bor Cs\u00e1nyi. Physical Review X, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 407\nAbstract: The success of first principles electronic structure calculation for predictive modeling in chemistry, solid state physics, and materials science is constrained by the limitations on simulated length and time scales due to computational cost and its scaling. Techniques based on machine learning ideas for interpolating the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface without explicitly describing electrons have recently shown great promise, but accurately and efficiently fitting the physically relevant space of configurations has remained a challenging goal. Here we present a Gaussian Approximation Potential for silicon that achieves this milestone, accurately reproducing density functional theory reference results for a wide range of observable properties, including crystal, liquid, and amorphous bulk phases, as well as point, line, and plane defects. We demonstrate that this new potential enables calculations that would be extremely expensive with a first principles electronic structure method, such as finite temperature phase boundary lines, self-diffusivity in the liquid, formation of the amorphous by slow quench, and dynamic brittle fracture. We show that the uncertainty quantification inherent to the Gaussian process regression framework gives a qualitative estimate of the potential's accuracy for a given atomic configuration. The success of this model shows that it is indeed possible to create a useful machine-learning-based interatomic potential that comprehensively describes a material, and serves as a template for the development of such models in the future.",

Machine Learning: Science and Technology, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 159\nAbstract: Data science and informatics tools have been proliferating recently within the computational materials science and catalysis fields. This proliferation has spurned the creation of various frameworks for automated materials screening, discovery, and design. Underpinning these frameworks are surrogate models with uncertainty estimates on their predictions. These uncertainty estimates are instrumental for determining which materials to screen next, but the computational catalysis field does not yet have a standard procedure for judging the quality of such uncertainty estimates. Here we present a suite of figures and performance metrics derived from the machine learning community that can be used to judge the quality of such uncertainty estimates. This suite probes the accuracy, calibration, and sharpness of a model quantitatively. We then show a case study where we judge various methods for predicting density-functional-theory-calculated adsorption energies. Of the methods studied here, we find that the best performer is a model where a convolutional neural network is used to supply features to a Gaussian process regressor, which then makes predictions of adsorption energies along with corresponding uncertainty estimates.",

JOM, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 34\nAbstract: Determining process\u2013structure\u2013property linkages is one of the key objectives in material science, and uncertainty quantification plays a critical role in understanding both process\u2013structure and structure\u2013property linkages. In this work, we seek to learn a distribution of microstructure parameters that are consistent in the sense that the forward propagation of this distribution through a crystal plasticity finite element model matches a target distribution on materials properties. This stochastic inversion formulation infers a distribution of acceptable/consistent microstructures, as opposed to a deterministic solution, which expands the range of feasible designs in a probabilistic manner. To solve this stochastic inverse problem, we employ a recently developed uncertainty quantification framework based on push-forward probability measures, which combines techniques from measure theory and Bayes\u2019 rule to define a unique and numerically stable solution. This approach requires making an initial prediction using an initial guess for the distribution on model inputs and solving a stochastic forward problem. To reduce the computational burden in solving both stochastic forward and stochastic inverse problems, we combine this approach with a machine learning Bayesian regression model based on Gaussian processes and demonstrate the proposed methodology on two representative case studies in structure\u2013property linkages.",

Scientific Reports, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 26\nAbstract: With the increased use of data-driven approaches and machine learning-based methods in material science, the importance of reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the predicted variables for informed decision-making cannot be overstated. UQ in material property prediction poses unique challenges, including multi-scale and multi-physics nature of materials, intricate interactions between numerous factors, limited availability of large curated datasets, etc. In this work, we introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) approach for UQ, which integrates knowledge from governing laws in materials to guide the models toward physically consistent predictions. To evaluate the approach, we present case studies for predicting the creep rupture life of steel alloys. Experimental validation with three datasets of creep tests demonstrates that this method produces point predictions and uncertainty estimations that are competitive or exceed the performance of conventional UQ methods such as Gaussian Process Regression. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of employing UQ in an active learning scenario and report competitive performance. The most promising framework for creep life prediction is BNNs based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior distribution of network parameters, as it provided more reliable results in comparison to BNNs based on variational inference approximation or related NNs with probabilistic outputs.",
        "5": "Assessing Uncertainty in Machine Learning for Polymer Property Prediction: A Benchmark Study. Hao Tang, Tianle Yue, Ying Li. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in material science, enabling accelerated discovery and design of novel molecules while reducing experimental costs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for enhancing the reliability of ML predictions, particularly in high-stakes applications, such as functional polymer discovery. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of nine UQ methods in ML\u2500ensemble, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), mean-variance estimation (MVE), Bayesian Neural Network based on Variational Inference (BNN-VI) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BNN-MCMC), evidential deep learning (EDL), quantile regression (QR), natural gradient boosting (NGBoost)\u2500for predicting key polymer properties, including glass transition temperature (Tg), band gap (Eg), melting temperature (Tm) and decomposition temperature (Td). The models are assessed using three independent metrics, including prediction accuracy (R2), Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and calibration area, offering a robust framework for evaluating both mean predictions and uncertainty estimates. Our analysis spans data sets of four properties, out-of-distribution (OOD) experimental and molecular dynamics (MD)-derived data, high-Tg polymers and diverse polymer types, providing a holistic perspective on model performance. Our findings reveal that optimal UQ method selection is highly context-dependent. Ensemble method consistently excelled for general in-distribution predictions across four properties. For challenging OOD scenarios, BNN-MCMC offered a strong balance of predictive accuracy and reliable UQ. NGBoost emerged as the top-performing method for high-Tg polymers, effectively balancing accuracy and uncertainty characterization, with Ensemble method also providing excellent accuracy in this case. Furthermore, BNN-VI demonstrated superior and consistent performance across the nine distinct polymer classes evaluated. This comprehensive benchmark underscores the critical importance of selecting tailored UQ strategies to enhance the trustworthiness of ML predictions, optimize experimental validation efforts, and ultimately accelerate the discovery of advanced functional polymers.",

        "7": "A Bayesian computational technique for learning the airflow resistance of acoustical fibrous materials at high temperatures. Thamasha Samarasinghe, Sumudu Herath. Building Acoustics, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: This study investigates the acoustic performance of various porous materials at elevated temperatures, employing Constrained Gaussian Process Regression (CGPR) to model the relationship between specific airflow resistance and the absolute temperature. Experimental data on six fibrous material samples at 600\u00b0C are used to develop and compare CGPR models against conventional Power Law Regression (PLR) methods. The developed CGPR incorporates constraints such as boundedness, monotonicity and convexity/concavity derived from the evident relationships and prior knowledge of the specific airflow resistance versus temperature variations. The results of this study prove the outperformance of the developed CGPR over PLR methods in terms of data efficiency, predictive accuracy, uncertainty quantification, overfitting recovery and extrapolation capability. This comparative analysis outlines a significant improvement in the predictive accuracy of CGPR, achieving improved coefficient of determination values compared to PLR. CGPR also furnishes a direct strategy to quantify the uncertainty of predictions which is vital for applications at elevated temperatures. Additionally, CGPR offers valuable insights into sound absorption behaviour, highlighting its applicability in thermal acoustics and materials engineering. Prospective research avenues stem from this research as the developed CGPR technique has the potential to replace various modelling techniques in materials science and acoustic engineering applications.",
