Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 40\nAbstract: Molecular property prediction is an important problem in drug discovery and materials science. As geometric structures have been demonstrated necessary for molecular property prediction,3D information has been combined with various graph learning methods to boost prediction performance. However, obtaining the geometric structure of molecules is not feasible in many real-world applications due to the high computational cost. In this work, we propose a novel 3D pre-training framework (dubbed 3D PGT), which pre-trains a model on 3D molecular graphs, and then fine-tunes it on molecular graphs without 3D structures. Based on fact that bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle are three basic geometric descriptors corresponding to a complete molecular 3D conformer, we first develop a multi-task generative pre-train framework based on these three attributes. Next, to automatically fuse these three generative tasks, we design a surrogate metric using the total energy to search for weight distribution of the three pretext tasks since total energy corresponding to the quality of 3D conformer. Extensive experiments on 2D molecular graphs are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and generalization ability of the proposed 3D PGT compared to various pre-training baselines.",

Chew, Matthew Sender, Zachary Kaplan, Anand Chandrasekaran, Jackson Chief Elk, A. Browning, H. Kwak, M. Halls, Mohammad Atif Faiz Afzal, Mohammad Atif, Faiz Afzal. Journal of Cheminformatics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 33\nAbstract: In materials science, accurately computing properties like viscosity, melting point, and glass transition temperatures solely through physics-based models is challenging. Data-driven machine learning (ML) also poses challenges in constructing ML models, especially in the material science domain where data is limited. To address this, we integrate physics-informed descriptors from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of ML models. Our current study focuses on accurately predicting viscosity in liquid systems using MD descriptors. In this work, we curated a comprehensive dataset of over 4000 small organic molecules\u2019 viscosities from scientific literature, publications, and online databases. This dataset enabled us to develop quantitative structure\u2013property relationships (QSPR) consisting of descriptor-based and graph neural network models to predict temperature-dependent viscosities for a wide range of viscosities. The QSPR models reveal that including MD descriptors improves the prediction of experimental viscosities, particularly at the small data set scale of fewer than a thousand data points. Furthermore, feature importance tools reveal that intermolecular interactions captured by MD descriptors are most important for viscosity predictions. Finally, the QSPR models can accurately capture the inverse relationship between viscosity and temperature for six battery-relevant solvents, some of which were not included in the original data set. Our research highlights the effectiveness of incorporating MD descriptors into QSPR models, which leads to improved accuracy for properties that are difficult to predict when using physics-based models alone or when limited data is available.

Zaixin Zhang, Qi Liu, Cheekong Lee, Chang-Yu Hsieh, Enhong Chen. bioRxiv, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 19\nAbstract: Designing molecules with desirable physiochemical properties and functionalities is a long-standing challenge in chemistry, material science, and drug discovery. Recently, machine learning-based generative models have emerged as promising approaches for de novo molecule design. However, further refinement of methodology is highly desired as most existing methods lack unified modeling of 2D topology and 3D geometry information and fail to effectively learn the structure-property relationship for molecule design. Here we present MolCode, a roto-translation equivariant generative framework for Molecular graph-structure Co-design. In MolCode, 3D geometric information empowers the molecular 2D graph generation, which in turn helps guide the prediction of molecular 3D structure. Extensive experimental results show that MolCode outperforms previous methods on a series of challenging tasks including de novo molecule design, targeted molecule discovery, and structure-based drug design. Particularly, MolCode not only consistently generates valid (99.95% Validity) and diverse (98.75% Uniqueness) molecular graphs/structures with desirable properties, but also generate drug-like molecules with high affinity to target proteins (61.8% high affinity ratio), which demonstrates MolCode\u2019s potential applications in material design and drug discovery. Our extensive investigation reveals that the 2D topology and 3D geometry contain intrinsically complementary information in molecule design, and provides new insights into machine learning-based molecule representation and generation.",

Chemical Science, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: Machine learning techniques including neural networks are popular tools for chemical, physical and materials applications searching for viable alternative methods in the analysis of structure and energetics of systems ranging from crystals to biomolecules. Efforts are less abundant for prediction of kinetics and dynamics. Here we explore the ability of three well established recurrent neural network architectures for reproducing and forecasting the energetics of a liquid solution of ethyl acetate containing a macromolecular polymer\u2013lipid aggregate at ambient conditions. Data models from three recurrent neural networks, ERNN, LSTM and GRU, are trained and tested on half million points time series of the macromolecular aggregate potential energy and its interaction energy with the solvent obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Our exhaustive analyses convey that the recurrent neural network architectures investigated generate data models that reproduce excellently the time series although their capability of yielding short or long term energetics forecasts with expected statistical distributions of the time points is limited. We propose an in silico protocol by extracting time patterns of the original series and utilizing these patterns to create an ensemble of artificial network models trained on an ensemble of time series seeded by the additional time patters. The energetics forecast improve, predicting a band of forecasted time series with a spread of values consistent with the molecular dynamics energy fluctuations span. Although the distribution of points from the band of energy forecasts is not optimal, the proposed in silico protocol provides useful estimates of the solvated macromolecular aggregate fate. Given the growing application of artificial networks in materials design, the data-based protocol presented here expands the realm of science areas where supervised machine learning serves as a decision making tool aiding the simulation practitioner to assess when long simulations are worth to be continued.",

Fedorov. IEEE Region International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Digital twin technology becomes an appropriate respond to the new challenge of rapid development in science and industry. Chemical data include the information about structure and properties of materials and compounds. Machine learning technology can help to predict properties of innovative compounds and material, but it takes enormous amount of raw data. The implementation of digital twin technology in spectral and molecular dynamics helps to reduce risks introducing the innovations. Large systems technologies are used in multiscale modeling of materials with computer programs. The world experience of chemical data aggregation and storage is based on specialized databases creation. Disunity of data sources demands a single multiscale data model to operate raw data and amend the accuracy of prediction. To collect and analyze unstructured data full-text search and distributed computing were applied. In respond to perpetual raw data expansion a Data Lake technology is used to store, analyze and search for information of atomic and molecular systems.",

Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Accurate prediction of molecular geometries is crucial for drug discovery and materials science. Existing fast conformer prediction algorithms often rely on approximate empirical energy functions, resulting in low accuracy. More accurate methods like ab initio molecular dynamics and Markov chain Monte Carlo can be computationally expensive due to the need for evaluating quantum mechanical energy functions. To address this, we introduce AGDIFF, a novel machine learning framework that utilizes diffusion models for efficient and accurate molecular structure prediction. AGDIFF extends previous models (such as GeoDiff) by enhancing the global, local, and edge encoders with attention mechanisms, an improved SchNet architecture, batch normalization, and feature expansion techniques. AGDIFF outperforms GeoDiff on both the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs data sets. For GEOM-QM9, with a threshold (\u03b4) of 0.5 \u00c5, AGDIFF achieves a mean COV-R of 93.08% and a mean MAT-R of 0.1965 \u00c5. On the more complex GEOM-Drugs data set, using \u03b4 = 1.25 \u00c5, AGDIFF attains a median COV-R of 100.00% and a mean MAT-R of 0.8237 \u00c5. These findings demonstrate AGDIFF\u2019s potential to advance molecular modeling techniques, enabling more efficient and accurate prediction of molecular geometries, thus contributing to computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials design. https://github.com/ADicksonLab/AGDIFF",
        "8": "Prediction of Molecular Conformation using Deep Generative Neural Networks. Congsheng Xu, Yi Lu, Xiaomei Deng, Peiyuan Yu. Chinese journal of chemistry, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The accurate prediction of molecular conformations with high efficiency is crucial in various fields such as materials science, computational chemistry and computer\u2010aided drug design, as the three\u2010dimensional structures accessible at a given condition usually determine the specific physical, chemical, and biological properties of a molecule. Traditional approaches for the conformational sampling of molecules such as molecular dynamics simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods either require an exponentially increasing amount of time as the degree of freedom of the molecule increases or suffer from systematic errors that fail to obtain important conformations, thus presenting significant challenges for conformation sampling with both high efficiency and high accuracy. Recently, deep learning\u2010\u2010based generative models have emerged as a promising solution to this problem. These models can generate a large number of molecular conformations in a short time, and their accuracy is comparable and, in some cases, even better than that of current popular open\u2010source and commercial software. This emerging topic introduces the recent progresses of using deep learning for predicting molecular conformations and briefly discusses the potential and challenges of this emerging field.This article is protected by copyright.

Ramprasad. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Designing polymers for targeted applications and accurately predicting their properties is a key challenge in materials science owing to the vast and complex polymer chemical space. While molecular language models have proven effective in solving analogous problems for molecular discovery, similar advancements for polymers are limited. To address this gap, we propose polyBART, a language model-driven polymer discovery capability that enables rapid and accurate exploration of the polymer design space. Central to our approach is Pseudo-polymer SELFIES (PSELFIES), a novel representation that allows for the transfer of molecular language models to the polymer space. polyBART is, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of bidirectional translation between polymer structures and properties, achieving state-of-the-art results in property prediction and design of novel polymers for electrostatic energy storage. Further, polyBART is validated through a combination of both computational and laboratory experiments. We report what we believe is the first successful synthesis and validation of a polymer designed by a language model, predicted to exhibit high thermal degradation temperature and confirmed by our laboratory measurements. Our work presents a generalizable strategy for adapting molecular language models to the polymer space and introduces a polymer foundation model, advancing generative polymer design that may be adapted for a variety of applications.",

Osei-Kuffuor. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Modeling the time-dependent evolution of electron density is essential for understanding quantum mechanical behaviors of condensed matter and enabling predictive simulations in spectroscopy, photochemistry, and ultrafast science. Yet, while machine learning methods have advanced static density prediction, modeling its spatiotemporal dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a generative framework that combines a 3D convolutional autoencoder with a latent diffusion model (LDM) to learn electron density trajectories from ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our method encodes electron densities into a compact latent space and predicts their future states by sampling from the learned conditional distribution, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without drift or collapse. To preserve statistical fidelity, we incorporate a scaled Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization that aligns generated and reference density distributions. On AIMD trajectories of liquid lithium at 800 K, our model accurately captures both the spatial correlations and the log-normal-like statistical structure of the density. The proposed framework has the potential to accelerate the simulation of quantum dynamics and overcome key challenges faced by current spatiotemporal machine learning methods as surrogates of quantum mechanical simulators."
