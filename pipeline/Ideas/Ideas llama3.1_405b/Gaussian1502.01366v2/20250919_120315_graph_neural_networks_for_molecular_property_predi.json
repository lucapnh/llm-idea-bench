The Web Conference, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 185\nAbstract: The recent success of graph neural networks has significantly boosted molecular property prediction, advancing activities such as drug discovery. The existing deep neural network methods usually require large training dataset for each property, impairing their performance in cases (especially for new molecular properties) with a limited amount of experimental data, which are common in real situations. To this end, we propose Meta-MGNN, a novel model for few-shot molecular property prediction. Meta-MGNN applies molecular graph neural network to learn molecular representations and builds a meta-learning framework for model optimization. To exploit unlabeled molecular information and address task heterogeneity of different molecular properties, Meta-MGNN further incorporates molecular structures, attribute based self-supervised modules and self-attentive task weights into the former framework, strengthening the whole learning model. Extensive experiments on two public multi-property datasets demonstrate that Meta-MGNN outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods.",

Journal of Materials Informatics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 28\nAbstract: Material molecular representation (MMR) plays an important role in material property or chemical reaction prediction. However, traditional expert-designed MMR methods face challenges in dealing with high dimensionality and heterogeneity of material data, leading to limited generalization capabilities and insufficient information representation. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs), a deep learning algorithm specifically designed for graph structures, have made inroads into the field of MMR. It will be instructive and inspiring to conduct a survey on various GNNs used for MMR. To achieve this objective, we compare GNNs with conventional MMR methods and illustrate the advantages of GNNs, such as their expressiveness and adaptability. In addition, we systematically classify and summarize the methods and applications of GNNs. Finally, we provide our insights into future research directions, taking into account the characteristics of molecular data and the inherent drawbacks of GNNs. This comprehensive survey is intended to present a holistic view of GNNs for MMR, focusing on the core concepts, the main techniques, and the future trends in this area.",

Junyang Hu, Zean Li, Jiaping Lin, Liangshun Zhang. ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 15\nAbstract: Establishing the structure-property relationship by machine learning (ML) models is extremely valuable for accelerating the molecular design of polymers. However, existing ML models for the polymers are subject to scarcity issues of training data and fewer variations of graph structures of molecules. In addition, limited works have explored the interpretability of ML models to infer the latent knowledge in the field of polymer science that could inspire ML-assisted molecular design. In this contribution, we integrate graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) with data augmentation strategy to predict the glass transition temperature Tg of polymers. It is demonstrated that the data-augmented GCN model outperforms the conventional models and achieves a higher accuracy for the prediction of Tg despite a small amount of training data. Furthermore, taking advantage of molecular graph representations, the data-augmented GCN model has the capability to infer the importance of atoms or substructures from the understanding of Tg, which generally agrees with the experimental findings in the field of polymer science. The inferred knowledge of the GCN model is used to advise on the design of functional polymers with specific Tg. The data-augmented GCN model possesses prominent superiorities in the establishment of structure-property relationship and also provides an efficient way for accelerating the rational design of polymer molecules.",

Neural computing & applications (Print), 2023.\nNumber of citations: 5\nAbstract: Graph neural networks and convolutional architectures have proven to be pivotal in improving the prediction of molecular properties in drug discovery. However, this is fundamentally a low data problem that is incompatible with regular deep learning approaches. Contemporary deep networks require large amounts of training data, which severely limits the prediction of new molecular entities from limited available data. In this paper, we address the challenge of low data in molecular property prediction by: (1) defining a set of deep learning architectures that accept compound chemical structures in the form of molecular graphs, (2) creating a few-shot learning strategy across graph neural networks and convolutional neural networks to leverage the rich information of graph embeddings, and (3) proposing a two-module meta-learning framework to learn from task-transferable knowledge and predict molecular properties on few-shot data. Furthermore, we conduct multiple experiments on two benchmark multiproperty datasets to demonstrate a superior performance over conventional graph-based baselines. ROC-AUC results for 10-shot experiments show an average improvement of $$+11.37\\%$$ + 11.37 % on Tox21 and $$+0.53\\%$$ + 0.53 % on SIDER, which are representative small-sized biological datasets for molecular property prediction.",

IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: Molecular property prediction is a key component of AI-driven drug discovery and molecular characterization learning. Despite recent advances, existing methods still face challenges such as limited ability to generalize, and inadequate representation of learning from unlabeled data, especially for tasks specific to molecular structures. To address these limitations, we introduce DIG-Mol, a novel self-supervised graph neural network framework for molecular property prediction. This architecture leverages the power of contrast learning with dual interaction mechanisms and unique molecular graph enhancement strategies. DIG-Mol integrates a momentum distillation network with two interconnected networks to efficiently improve molecular characterization. The framework's ability to extract key information about molecular structure and higher-order semantics is supported by minimizing loss of contrast. We have established DIG-Mol's state-of-the-art performance through extensive experimental evaluation in a variety of molecular property prediction tasks. In addition to demonstrating superior transferability in a small number of learning scenarios, our visualizations highlight DIG-Mol's enhanced interpretability and representation capabilities. These findings confirm the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming challenges faced by traditional methods and mark a significant advance in molecular property prediction.",

ICBAR, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) have shown promise in leveraging quantum computing to enhance graph-structured data learning, yet they are typically limited to homogeneous graphs. In this paper, we introduce the quantum heterogeneous graph neural network (QHGNN), which integrates heterogeneity as an inductive bias within quantum circuits, enabling effective learning on heterogeneous graphs. By encoding diverse node and edge types directly into the quantum circuit architecture, QHGNN can capture complex relationships intrinsic to heterogeneous molecular data.

International Conference on Machine Learning, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The prediction of molecular properties is a crucial task in the field of material and drug discovery. The potential benefits of using deep learning techniques are reflected in the wealth of recent literature. Still, these techniques are faced with a common challenge in practice: Labeled data are limited by the cost of manual extraction from literature and laborious experimentation. In this work, we propose a data-efficient property predictor by utilizing a learnable hierarchical molecular grammar that can generate molecules from grammar production rules. Such a grammar induces an explicit geometry of the space of molecular graphs, which provides an informative prior on molecular structural similarity. The property prediction is performed using graph neural diffusion over the grammar-induced geometry. On both small and large datasets, our evaluation shows that this approach outperforms a wide spectrum of baselines, including supervised and pre-trained graph neural networks. We include a detailed ablation study and further analysis of our solution, showing its effectiveness in cases with extremely limited data. Code is available at https://github.com/gmh14/Geo-DEG.",

Badman, Lachele Foley, Robert Woods, Pengyu Hong. arXiv.org, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Molecular representation learning (MRL) is a powerful tool for bridging the gap between machine learning and chemical sciences, as it converts molecules into numerical representations while preserving their chemical features. These encoded representations serve as a foundation for various downstream biochemical studies, including property prediction and drug design. MRL has had great success with proteins and general biomolecule datasets. Yet, in the growing sub-field of glycoscience (the study of carbohydrates, where longer carbohydrates are also called glycans), MRL methods have been barely explored. This under-exploration can be primarily attributed to the limited availability of comprehensive and well-curated carbohydrate-specific datasets and a lack of Machine learning (ML) pipelines specifically tailored to meet the unique problems presented by carbohydrate data. Since interpreting and annotating carbohydrate-specific data is generally more complicated than protein data, domain experts are usually required to get involved. The existing MRL methods, predominately optimized for proteins and small biomolecules, also cannot be directly used in carbohydrate applications without special modifications. To address this challenge, accelerate progress in glycoscience, and enrich the data resources of the MRL community, we introduce GlycoNMR. GlycoNMR contains two laboriously curated datasets with 2,609 carbohydrate structures and 211,543 annotated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts for precise atomic-level prediction. We tailored carbohydrate-specific features and adapted existing MRL models to tackle this problem effectively. For illustration, we benchmark four modified MRL models on our new datasets."
