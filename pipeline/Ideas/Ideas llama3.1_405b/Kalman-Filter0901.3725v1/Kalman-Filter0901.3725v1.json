By incorporating robust statistical methods, such as trimmed ensemble Kalman filter or Gaussian mixture ensemble Kalman filter, our approach aims to provide a more accurate and reliable state estimation method for complex systems.",

By modeling the uncertainty of feature distributions using Kalman filters, our approach enables more effective knowledge transfer between domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on various benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain classification tasks.",
