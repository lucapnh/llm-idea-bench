        "description": "We propose a novel approach to improve the robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by incorporating multi-modal fusion. Our method leverages the strengths of both visual and textual modalities to enhance the retrieval phase, re-ranking stage, and generation process. We conduct a systematic dissection of the RAG pipeline, exploring different modality configurations, retrieval strategies, and integration methods. Our results show that our approach yields substantial performance boosts without any fine-tuning.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Training a single language model to decide when to retrieve, how to generate, and whether its output is supported via special 'reflection tokens' can yield higher factuality and controllable behavior.",
        "Related Work": "Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems indiscriminately fetch a fixed number of passages and do not verify that generated claims are supported. SELF-RAG addresses these issues by training one LM to retrieve on demand, generate, and self-critique using reflection tokens.",
        "Abstract": "SELF-RAG trains a single language model to decide when to retrieve, how to generate, and whether its output is supported via special 'reflection tokens.' This yields higher factuality and controllable behavior, surpassing strong RAG and non-RAG baselines on QA, reasoning, and long-form tasks with better citation precision/recall.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Can we meta-learn an adaptive retrieval strategy that generalizes across diverse queries and tasks, improving the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models?",
        "Related Work": "Existing RAG frameworks rely on rigid single-class classifiers or reinforcement learning-based approaches to select retrieval methods. Our proposal differs by exploring meta-learning for adapting retrieval strategies, enabling more efficient and effective generalization across diverse queries and tasks.",
        "Methodology": "We will design a meta-learning framework that trains an adaptive retrieval strategy using a set of diverse query tasks. The framework will consist of a retriever network, a generator network, and a meta-learner. The retriever network will learn to select relevant documents based on the input query. The generator network will use the retrieved documents to generate a response. The meta-learner will update the retriever and generator networks using a meta-learning algorithm, such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML).",
        "Expected Outcomes": "Our proposed framework is expected to outperform existing RAG frameworks in terms of generalization across diverse queries and tasks. We also expect our approach to improve the efficiency of retrieval, reducing computational costs and latency."

In this study, we evaluate the robustness of RAG systems to adversarial retrieval and propose a framework for improving their resilience.",
        "Methodology": "We design an experimental setup where we manipulate the retrieved documents to simulate an adversarial attack. We then evaluate the performance of various RAG systems under these conditions, using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROUGE score. Finally, we propose a framework for improving the robustness of RAG systems to adversarial retrieval, which involves incorporating adversarial training into the RAG system.",
        "Expected Outcomes": "We expect our results to show that RAG systems are vulnerable to adversarial retrieval and that our proposed framework can improve their resilience. Our study will contribute to the development of more robust RAG systems and shed light on the importance of evaluating their robustness to adversarial attacks."
