        "Short Hypothesis": "By empowering large language models to autonomously control the search process via self-guided exploration, we can improve their reasoning and planning capabilities across various tasks.",
        "Related Work": "Our proposal builds upon recent advances in using large language models for reasoning and planning, such as Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) and Monte Carlo Planning with Large Language Model. However, our approach differs by removing the need for pre-defined search strategies and instead allowing the model to guide its own exploration.",
        "Abstract": "We propose a novel self-guided search method that empowers large language models to autonomously control the search process via internal scoring mechanisms. Our approach enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate our method on various tasks, including Countdown and Sudoku, and demonstrate improved performance compared to classic search algorithms.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "By integrating large language models with cognitive architectures that incorporate reasoning, memory, and learning mechanisms, we can create more generalizable, flexible, and human-like intelligent systems.",
        "Related Work": "Our proposal builds upon the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, which enables large language models to explore, evaluate, and backtrack across multiple reasoning paths. However, ToT focuses primarily on reasoning and planning, whereas our approach integrates cognitive architectures that incorporate memory and learning mechanisms, providing a more comprehensive framework for general intelligence.",
        "Abstract": "We propose the integration of large language models with cognitive architectures that incorporate reasoning, memory, and learning mechanisms. Our approach combines the strengths of symbolic reasoning, connectionist learning, and hierarchical representations to create more generalizable, flexible, and human-like intelligent systems. We evaluate our method on various tasks that require reasoning, problem-solving, and learning, including complex decision-making scenarios and multi-step planning problems.",
