        "Description": "This project proposes a novel approach to offline reinforcement learning by leveraging multimodal sequence modeling. The goal is to develop an algorithm that can effectively learn from offline datasets and make decisions in complex, dynamic environments.",
        "Methodology": "The proposed approach will combine the strengths of sequence modeling and multimodal fusion techniques. Specifically, we will use a Decision Transformer-like architecture as the backbone and incorporate multimodal fusion mechanisms to handle different types of input data (e.g., text, images, audio).",
        "Expected_Outcomes": "We expect the proposed approach to outperform existing offline RL methods in terms of performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited or corrupted data.",
        "Evaluation_Metrics": "The algorithm will be evaluated on a range of offline RL benchmarks, including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit tasks. We will also assess its robustness against data corruption and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods."

        "Related Work": "While there have been efforts to combine symbolic and subsymbolic AI in various domains, the application of cognitive architectures to reinforcement learning is relatively unexplored. Our work builds upon existing research in cognitive architectures, such as the Robotic Skill Acquisition (RSA) architecture, and seeks to integrate these concepts with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.",

By combining the strengths of both paradigms, we aim to develop more robust, explainable, and adaptable decision-making systems. Our architecture will incorporate elements from cognitive architectures, such as attention mechanisms and working memory, with deep reinforcement learning methods.",
