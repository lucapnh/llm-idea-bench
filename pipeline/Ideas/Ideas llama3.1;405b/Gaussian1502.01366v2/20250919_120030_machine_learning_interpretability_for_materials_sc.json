Accounts of Materials Research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 177\nAbstract: While the uptake of data-driven approaches for materials science and chemistry is at an exciting, early stage, to realise the true potential of machine learning models for successful scientific discovery, they must have qualities beyond purely predictive power. The predictions and inner workings of models should provide a certain degree of explainability by human experts, permitting the identification of potential model issues or limitations, building trust on model predictions and unveiling unexpected correlations that may lead to scientific insights. In this work, we summarize applications of interpretability and explainability techniques for materials science and chemistry and discuss how these techniques can improve the outcome of scientific studies. We discuss various challenges for interpretable machine learning in materials science and, more broadly, in scientific settings. In particular, we emphasize the risks of inferring causation or reaching generalization by purely interpreting machine learning models and the need of uncertainty estimates for model explanations. Finally, we showcase a number of exciting developments in other fields that could benefit interpretability in material science and chemistry problems.",

Frontiers in Materials, 2016.\nNumber of citations: 152\nAbstract: Materials scientists are increasingly adopting the use of machine learning tools to discover hidden trends in data and make predictions. Applying concepts from data science without foreknowledge of their limitations and the unique qualities of materials data, however, could lead to errant conclusions. The differences that exist between various kinds of experimental and calculated data require careful choices of data processing and machine learning methods. Here, we outline potential pitfalls involved in using machine learning without robust protocols. We address some problems of overfitting to training data using decision trees as an example, rational descriptor selection in the field of perovskites, and preserving physical interpretability in the application of dimensionality reducing techniques such as principal component analysis. We show how proceeding without the guidance of domain knowledge can lead to both quantitatively and qualitatively incorrect predictive models.",

Sholl, J. Siepmann, R. Snurr. Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 33\nAbstract: A major obstacle for machine learning (ML) in chemical science is the lack of physically informed feature representations that provide both accurate prediction and easy interpretability of the ML model. In this work, we describe adsorption systems using novel two-dimensional energy histogram (2D-EH) features, which are obtained from the probe-adsorbent energies and energy gradients at grid points located throughout the adsorbent. The 2D-EH features encode both energetic and structural information of the material and lead to highly accurate ML models (coefficient of determination R2 \u223c 0.94-0.99) for predicting single-component adsorption capacity in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). We consider the adsorption of spherical molecules (Kr and Xe), linear alkanes with a wide range of aspect ratios (ethane, propane, n-butane, and n-hexane), and a branched alkane (2,2-dimethylbutane) over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The interpretable 2D-EH features enable the ML model to learn the basic physics of adsorption in pores from the training data. We show that these MOF-data-trained ML models are transferrable to different families of amorphous nanoporous materials. We also identify several adsorption systems where capillary condensation occurs, and ML predictions are more challenging. Nevertheless, our 2D-EH features still outperform structural features including those derived from persistent homology. The novel 2D-EH features may help accelerate the discovery and design of advanced nanoporous materials using ML for gas storage and separation in the future.",

Chew, Matthew Sender, Zachary Kaplan, Anand Chandrasekaran, Jackson Chief Elk, A. Browning, H. Kwak, M. Halls, Mohammad Atif Faiz Afzal, Mohammad Atif, Faiz Afzal. Journal of Cheminformatics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 33\nAbstract: In materials science, accurately computing properties like viscosity, melting point, and glass transition temperatures solely through physics-based models is challenging. Data-driven machine learning (ML) also poses challenges in constructing ML models, especially in the material science domain where data is limited. To address this, we integrate physics-informed descriptors from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of ML models. Our current study focuses on accurately predicting viscosity in liquid systems using MD descriptors. In this work, we curated a comprehensive dataset of over 4000 small organic molecules\u2019 viscosities from scientific literature, publications, and online databases. This dataset enabled us to develop quantitative structure\u2013property relationships (QSPR) consisting of descriptor-based and graph neural network models to predict temperature-dependent viscosities for a wide range of viscosities. The QSPR models reveal that including MD descriptors improves the prediction of experimental viscosities, particularly at the small data set scale of fewer than a thousand data points. Furthermore, feature importance tools reveal that intermolecular interactions captured by MD descriptors are most important for viscosity predictions. Finally, the QSPR models can accurately capture the inverse relationship between viscosity and temperature for six battery-relevant solvents, some of which were not included in the original data set. Our research highlights the effectiveness of incorporating MD descriptors into QSPR models, which leads to improved accuracy for properties that are difficult to predict when using physics-based models alone or when limited data is available.

Goddard III, Caichao Ye, Wenqing Zhang. Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 12\nAbstract: The graph representation of complex materials plays a crucial role in the field of inorganic and organic materials investigations for developing data-centric materials science, such as those using graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the currently prevalent GNN models are primarily employed for investigating periodic crystals and organic small molecule data, yet they still encounter challenges in terms of interpretability and computational efficiency when applied to polymer monomers and organic macromolecules data. There is still a lack of graph representation of organic polymers and macromolecules specifically tailored for GNN models to explore the structural characteristics. The Polymer-unit Graph, a novel coarse-grained graph representation method introduced in study, is dedicated to expressing and analyzing polymers and macromolecules. By incorporating the Polymer-unit Graph into the GNN models and analyzing the organic semiconductor (OSC) materials database, it becomes possible to uncover intricate structure-property relationships involving branched-chain engineering, fluoridation substitution, and donor-acceptor combination effects on the elementary structure of OSC polymers. Furthermore, the Polymer-unit Graph enables visualizing the relationship between target properties and polymer units while reducing training time by an impressive 98% and minimizing molecular graph representation models. In conclusion, the Polymer-unit Graph successfully integrates the concept of Polymer-unit into the field of GNNs, enabling more accurate analysis and understanding of organic polymers and macromolecules.",

Songyang Zhang, Xiaojie He, Peng Xiao, Xuejian Xia, Feng Zheng, Shuangfei Xiang, Qinghua Lu. Advanced Functional Materials, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 12\nAbstract: With the rapid development of flexible displays and wearable electronics, there are a substantial demand for colorless transparent polyimide (CPI) films with different properties. Traditional trial\u2010and\u2010error experimental methods are time\u2010consuming and costly, and density functional theory based prediction of HOMO\u2010LUMO gap energy also takes time and is prone to varying degrees of error. Inspired by machine learning (ML) applications in molecular and materials science, this paper proposed a data\u2010driven ML strategy to study the correlation between microscopic molecular mechanisms and macroscopic optical properties. Based on varying degrees of impact of various molecular features on the cutoff wavelength (\u03bbcutoff), the ML algorithm is first used to quickly and accurately predict the \u03bbcutoff of CPI. Several new CPI films are then designed and prepared based on the key molecular features, and the predicted values of their \u03bbcutoff are effectively verified within the experimental error range. The interpretability provided by the model allows to establish correlations between the nine key descriptors identified and their physicochemical meanings. The contributions are also analyzed to the transparency of polyimide films, thereby giving insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying transparency modulation for CPIs.",

Nanomaterials, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: The band gap is a key parameter in semiconductor materials that is essential for advancing optoelectronic device development. Accurately predicting band gaps of materials at low cost is a significant challenge in materials science. Although many machine learning (ML) models for band gap prediction already exist, they often suffer from low interpretability and lack theoretical support from a physical perspective. In this study, we address these challenges by using a combination of traditional ML algorithms and the \u2018white-box\u2019 sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) approach. Specifically, we enhance the interpretability and accuracy of band gap predictions for binary semiconductors by integrating the importance rankings of support vector regression (SVR), random forests (RF), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) with SISSO models. Our model uses only the intrinsic features of the constituent elements and their band gaps calculated using the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof method, significantly reducing computational demands. We have applied our model to predict the band gaps of 1208 theoretically stable binary compounds. Importantly, the model highlights the critical role of electronegativity in determining material band gaps. This insight not only enriches our understanding of the physical principles underlying band gap prediction but also underscores the potential of our approach in guiding the synthesis of new and valuable semiconductor materials.",

Crystals, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The field of materials science has experienced a transformative shift with the emergence of high-entropy materials (HEMs), which possess a unique combination of properties that traditional single-phase materials lack. Among these, high-entropy nitrides (HENs) stand out for their exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability, and resistance to extreme environments, making them highly sought after for applications in aerospace, defense, and energy sectors. Central to the design of these materials is their entropy forming ability (EFA), a measure of a material\u2019s propensity to form a single-phase, disordered structure. This study introduces the application of the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO), a machine learning technique, to predict the EFA of HEN ceramics. By utilizing a rich dataset curated from theoretical computational data, SISSO has been trained to identify the most critical features contributing to EFA. The model\u2019s strong interpretability allows for the extraction of complex mathematical expressions, providing deep insights into the material\u2019s composition and its impact on EFA. The predictive performance of the SISSO model is meticulously validated against theoretical benchmarks and compared with other machine learning methodologies, demonstrating its superior accuracy and reliability. This research not only contributes to the growing body of knowledge on HEMs but also paves the way for the efficient discovery and development of new HEN materials with tailored properties for advanced technological applications.",
