        "Related Work": "Our work builds upon recent advances in generative modeling, including diffusion models, flow-based models, and characteristic learning.

Our approach leverages characteristic learning and probability flow ODEs to describe the transport of probability density along characteristics, allowing for a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. We analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for our model in 2-Wasserstein distance. Our experiments demonstrate high generation quality with just a single evaluation of the neural network.",
