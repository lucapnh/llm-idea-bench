        "1": "Machine Learning for Staggered Difference-in-Differences and Dynamic Treatment Effect Heterogeneity. Julia Hatamyar, Noemi Kreif, Rudi Rocha, Martin Huber. , 2023.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: We combine two recently proposed nonparametric difference-in-differences methods, extending them to enable the examination of treatment effect heterogeneity in the staggered adoption setting using machine learning. The proposed method, machine learning difference-in-differences (MLDID), allows for estimation of time-varying conditional average treatment effects on the treated, which can be used to conduct detailed inference on drivers of treatment effect heterogeneity. We perform simulations to evaluate the performance of MLDID and find that it accurately identifies the true predictors of treatment effect heterogeneity. We then use MLDID to evaluate the heterogeneous impacts of Brazil's Family Health Program on infant mortality, and find those in poverty and urban locations experienced the impact of the policy more quickly than other subgroups.",
        "2": "Fused Extended Two-Way Fixed Effects for Difference-in-Differences With Staggered Adoptions. Gregory Faletto. , 2023.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: To address the bias of the canonical two-way fixed effects estimator for difference-in-differences under staggered adoptions, Wooldridge (2021) proposed the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, which adds many parameters. However, this reduces efficiency. Restricting some of these parameters to be equal (for example, subsequent treatment effects within a cohort) helps, but ad hoc restrictions may reintroduce bias. We propose a machine learning estimator with a single tuning parameter, fused extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE), that enables automatic data-driven selection of these restrictions. We prove that under an appropriate sparsity assumption FETWFE identifies the correct restrictions with probability tending to one, which improves efficiency. We also prove the consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality of FETWFE for several classes of heterogeneous marginal treatment effect estimators under either conditional or marginal parallel trends, and we prove the same results for conditional average treatment effects under conditional parallel trends. We provide an R package implementing fused extended two-way fixed effects, and we demonstrate FETWFE in simulation studies and an empirical application.",
        "3": "Bridging Structural Causal Inference and Machine Learning The S-DIDML Estimator for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects. Yile Yu, Anzhi Xu. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: In response to the increasing complexity of policy environments and the proliferation of high-dimensional data, this paper introduces the S-DIDML estimator a framework grounded in structure and semiparametrically flexible for causal inference. By embedding Difference-in-Differences (DID) logic within a Double Machine Learning (DML) architecture, the S-DIDML approach combines the strengths of temporal identification, machine learning-based nuisance adjustment, and orthogonalized estimation. We begin by identifying critical limitations in existing methods, including the lack of structural interpretability in ML models, instability of classical DID under high-dimensional confounding, and the temporal rigidity of standard DML frameworks. Building on recent advances in staggered adoption designs and Neyman orthogonalization, S-DIDML offers a five-step estimation pipeline that enables robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) while maintaining interpretability and scalability. Demonstrative applications are discussed across labor economics, education, taxation, and environmental policy. The proposed framework contributes to the methodological frontier by offering a blueprint for policy-relevant, structurally interpretable, and statistically valid causal analysis in complex data settings."
