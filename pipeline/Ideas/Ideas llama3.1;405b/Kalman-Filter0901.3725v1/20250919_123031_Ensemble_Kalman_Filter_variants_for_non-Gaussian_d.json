Heemink. Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 5\nAbstract: This work proposes a robust and non-Gaussian version of the shrinkage-based knowledge-aided EnKF implementation called Ensemble Time Local H\u221e Filter Knowledge-Aided (EnTLHF-KA). The EnTLHF-KA requires a target covariance matrix to integrate previously obtained information and knowledge directly into the data assimilation (DA). The proposed method is based on the robust H\u221e filter and on its ensemble time-local version the EnTLHF, using an adaptive inflation factor depending on the shrinkage covariance estimated matrix. This implies a theoretical and solid background to construct robust filters from the well-known covariance inflation technique. The proposed technique is implemented in a synthetic assimilation experiment, and in an air quality application using the LOTOS-EUROS model over the Aburr\u00e1 Valley to evaluate its potential for non-linear and non-Gaussian large systems. In the spatial distribution of the PM2.5 concentrations along the valley, the method outperforms the well-known Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), and the non-robust knowledge-aided Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF-KA). In contrast to the other simulations, the ability to issue warnings for high concentration events is also increased. Finally, the simulation using EnTLHF-KA has lower error values than using EnKF-KA, indicating the advantages of robust approaches in high uncertainty systems.",

IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: The Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) represent a versatile class of data-driven nonlinear dynamical system models. However, the presence of numerous latent variables in GPSSM incurs unresolved issues for existing variational inference approaches, particularly under the more realistic non-mean-field (NMF) assumption, including extensive training effort, compromised inference accuracy, and infeasibility for online applications, among others. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by incorporating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a well-established model-based filtering technique, into the NMF variational inference framework to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent states. This novel marriage between EnKF and GPSSM not only eliminates the need for extensive parameterization in learning variational distributions, but also enables an interpretable, closed-form approximation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Moreover, owing to the streamlined parameterization via the EnKF, the new GPSSM model can be easily accommodated in online learning applications. We demonstrate that the resulting EnKF-aided online algorithm embodies a principled objective function by ensuring data-fitting accuracy while incorporating model regularizations to mitigate overfitting. We also provide detailed analysis and fresh insights for the proposed algorithms. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse real and synthetic datasets corroborates the superior learning and inference performance of our EnKF-aided variational inference algorithms compared to existing methods.",

Rosenthal, Guang Lin. , 2018.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: We study the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm for sequential data assimilation in a general situation, that is, for nonlinear forecast and measurement models with non-additive and non-Gaussian noises. Such applications traditionally force us to choose between inaccurate Gaussian assumptions that permit efficient algorithms (e.g., EnKF), or more accurate direct sampling methods which scale poorly with dimension (e.g., particle filters, or PF). We introduce a trimmed ensemble Kalman filter (TEnKF) which can interpolate between the limiting distributions of the EnKF and PF to facilitate adaptive control over both accuracy and efficiency. This is achieved by introducing a trimming function that removes non-Gaussian outliers that introduce errors in the correlation between the model and observed forecast, which otherwise prevent the EnKF from proposing accurate forecast updates. We show for specific trimming functions that the TEnKF exactly reproduces the limiting distributions of the EnKF and PF. We also develop an adaptive implementation which provides control of the effective sample size and allows the filter to overcome periods of increased model nonlinearity. This algorithm allow us to demonstrate substantial improvements over the traditional EnKF in convergence and robustness for the nonlinear Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 models.",

Tingting Zhang, Wen Zhang. 2024 9th Asia Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE), 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: To ensure the secure and reliable operation of active distribution systems (ADSs), it is essential to efficiently and accurately identify their time-varying topology. This paper proposes an estimation-based topology identification (TI) method for ADSs considering topology changes. The TI problem is formulated by a forecasting-aided estimation model, which is depicted by a discrete-time switching state-space model. The topology change process is described by a Bayesian nonparametric model that allows TI with limited knowledge of topology libraries. Then the Gaussian mixture ensemble Kalman filter (GM-EnKF) is employed to carry out the TI, where the underlying probability density is approximated by using Gaussian mixture model. In this case, the proposed method become capable of handling the unavoidable non-Gaussian noises in realistic distribution systems. Test results on various ADSs validates the effectiveness of the proposed GM-EnKF-based TI method on accurate and efficient topology identification.",

Arellano, C. Granier, L. Emmons, Ivan Ortega, J. Hannigan, W. Tang, H. Worden, D. Ziskin, David P. Edwards. Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Satellite retrievals of carbon monoxide (CO) are routinely assimilated in atmospheric chemistry models to improve air quality forecasts, produce reanalyzes and to estimate emissions. This study applies the quantile\u2010conserving ensemble filter framework, a novel assimilation algorithm that can deal with non\u2010Gaussian and modestly nonlinear distributions. Instead of assuming normal distributions like the Ensemble Adjustments Kalman Filter (EAKF), we now apply a bounded normal rank histogram (BNRH) distribution for the prior. The goal is to efficiently estimate bounded quantities such as CO atmospheric mixing ratios and emission fluxes while maintaining the good performance achieved by the EAKF. We contrast assimilating meteorological and MOPITT (Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere) observations for May 2018. We evaluate the results with the fourth deployment of the NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom\u20104) airborne field campaign. We also compare simulations with CO tropospheric columns from the network for the detection of atmospheric composition change and surface in\u2010situ observations from NOAA carbon cycle greenhouse gases. While the differences remain small, the BNRH approach clearly works better than the EAKF in comparison to all observation data sets.",
