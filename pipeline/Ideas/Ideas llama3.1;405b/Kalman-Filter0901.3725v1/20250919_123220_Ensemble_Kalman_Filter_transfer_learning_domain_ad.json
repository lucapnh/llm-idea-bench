Structural Health Monitoring, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 24\nAbstract: Domain adaptation-based transfer learning methods have been widely investigated in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, but their basic convolution or recurrent structure is subject to poor global feature representation ability, which hinders the learning of domain-irrelevant modulation information. In addition, the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of deep learning models limits their applications in high risk-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, an interpretable domain adaptation transformer (IDAT) is proposed for the transferable fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. First, a multi-layer domain adaptation transformer framework is proposed, which can capture the global information that is crucial for learning the modulation information of different domains, and meanwhile reduce the feature distribution discrepancy. Second, an ensemble attention weight is applied to enable the transfer learning framework to be interpretable, which is implemented by averaging the integral values of the multi-head attention maps along the key direction. In addition, the raw vibration signals are embedded as the input of the model, which provides an end-to-end fault diagnosis. The proposed IDAT is tested by various cross-condition and cross-machine bearing fault diagnosis tasks, and results confirm the advantages of the method.",

IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 14\nAbstract: Multisource domain adaptation (MDA) aims to transfer knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. However, the severe intradomain and interdomain shifts exacerbate the difficulty of knowledge transfer. Besides, the potential knowledge embedded within and across source domains is often ignored by past work. In this article, we propose a dual-level alignment network with ensemble learning (DANE) to address the above limitations for MDA classification tasks. Concretely, to deal with the intradomain shift, we present an intradomain alignment by employing a novel clustering loss with a batchwise prediction similarity matrix (PSM) to foster a discriminative and well-clustered target feature space inside the target domain. To tackle the interdomain shift, we introduce an interdomain alignment loss with a dynamic weighting function to allocate greater weights to samples with higher uncertainty, thus leading to a more precise alignment between the source and target distributions. Moreover, to comprehensively harness the inherent knowledge present within and across the source domains, we leverage the principles of ensemble learning. This involves constructing an ensemble source that amalgamates all individual source domains, enabling us to fully explore the domain-invariant knowledge embedded within the source data. Subsequently, we employ an ensemble-weighted decision integration strategy, which facilitates the fusion of beneficial knowledge from each source domain, resulting in an optimal exploration and utilization of the domain-invariant knowledge for enhanced classification performance. Extensive experiments on five MDA benchmark datasets demonstrate that DANE outperforms other methods by a significant margin, defining the new state of the art (SOTA). Moreover, we also validate the proposed DANE in open-world scenarios, which further shows the effectiveness of our method.",

Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: We present a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in sensors performing object tracking. Our objective is to enhance the accuracy of estimation in the tracking domain, particularly in scenarios where reliable measurements are difficult to obtain due to environmental conditions affecting a specific sensor. To accomplish this, we propose a framework that integrates transfer learning techniques into an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). We introduce an additional step to model and learn the parameters of predicted observations in a learning domain at each time step. By incorporating the learned knowledge from the learning domain into the filtering process of the tracking domain, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in tracking accuracy. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of tracking accuracy, comparing its performance to that of the traditional isolated UKF.",

IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: Deepreinforcement learning algorithms offer a promising method for industrial robots to tackle unstructured and complex scenarios that are difficult to model. However, due to constraints related to equipment lifespan and safety requirements, acquiring a number of samples directly from the physical environment is often infeasible. With the development of increasingly realistic simulators, it has become feasible for industrial robots to acquire complex motion skills within simulated environments. Nonetheless, the \u201creality gap\u201d frequently results in performance degradation when transferring policies trained in simulators to physical systems. In this letter, we treat the reality gap between a physical environment (target domain) and a simulated environment (source domain) as a Gaussian perturbation and utilize Kalman filtering to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domain data. We refine the source domain controller using target domain data to enhance the controller's adaptability to the target domain. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in reaching tasks and peg-in-hole tasks conducted on PR2 and UR5 robotic platforms.",

IEEE Sensors Journal, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: Domain adaptation (DA) models for fault diagnosis typically assume a shared label space between source and target domains. However, in real industrial applications, the target label space is often a subset of the source label space, potentially resulting in negative transfer due to uncertain propagation from source-only classes. To address this challenge, a novel manifold embedded ensemble partial DA (MEEPDA) approach is proposed. First, we proposed a novel discriminative manifold learning (DML) method based on density peak landmark selection (DPLS) to mitigate degenerated feature transformation in the PDA process. DPLS leverages the relative density metric to select density peaks as landmarks, thereby reducing the influence of interfering instances. Subsequently, DML learns a robust discriminative manifold mapping based on these landmarks to align the geometrical structures of two domains. Second, to promote positive transfer between shared categories and mitigate the risk of negative transfer from source-only classes, we propose a novel joint weighting mechanism (JWM) that incorporates entropy-based class-wise weighting and adaptive instance-wise weighting using the ${l}_{\\text {2,1}}$ -norm structured sparsity regularizer. Then, MEEPDA combines the maximum mean and covariance discrepancy (MMCD) metric and the JWM to learn a feature adaptation matrix A by aligning the weighted marginal and class-conditional distributions. Finally, MEEPDA learns an integrated classifier by utilizing a majority voting strategy within a unified objective function, aiming to improve the prediction accuracy and generalization performance. The experimental results on two gearbox databases across 19 transfer tasks demonstrate that MEEPDA outperforms existing partial DA methods.",

Minmin Miao, Zhong Yang, Zhenzhen Sheng, Baoguo Xu, Wenbin Zhang, Xinmin Cheng. Physiological Measurement, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important kind of bioelectric signal for measuring physiological activities of the brain, and motor imagery (MI) EEG has significant clinical application prospects. Convolutional neural network has become a mainstream algorithm for MI EEG classification, however lack of subject-specific data considerably restricts its decoding accuracy and generalization performance. To address this challenge, a novel transfer learning (TL) framework using auxiliary dataset to improve the MI EEG classification performance of target subject is proposed in this paper. Approach. We developed a multi-source deep domain adaptation ensemble framework (MSDDAEF) for cross-dataset MI EEG decoding. The proposed MSDDAEF comprises three main components: model pre-training, deep domain adaptation, and multi-source ensemble. Moreover, for each component, different designs were examined to verify the robustness of MSDDAEF. Main results. Bidirectional validation experiments were performed on two large public MI EEG datasets (openBMI and GIST). The highest average classification accuracy of MSDDAEF reaches 74.28% when openBMI serves as target dataset and GIST serves as source dataset. While the highest average classification accuracy of MSDDAEF is 69.85% when GIST serves as target dataset and openBMI serves as source dataset. In addition, the classification performance of MSDDAEF surpasses several well-established studies and state-of-the-art algorithms. Significance. The results of this study show that cross-dataset TL is feasible for left/right-hand MI EEG decoding, and further indicate that MSDDAEF is a promising solution for addressing MI EEG cross-dataset variability.",

Mathematics, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Adversarial transfer learning is extensively applied in computer vision owing to its remarkable capability in addressing domain adaptation. However, its applications in credit scoring remain underexplored due to the complexity of financial data. The performance of traditional credit scoring models relies on the consistency of domain distribution. Any shift in feature distribution leads to a degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a domain adaptation framework comprising a transfer learner and a decision tree. The framework integrates the following: (1) feature partitioning through Wassertein relevance metric; (2) adversarial training of the transfer learner using features with significant distributional differences to achieve an inseparable representation of the source and target domains, while the remaining features are utilized for decision tree model training; and (3) a weighted voting method combines the predictions of the transfer learner and the decision tree. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was used to analyze the predictions of the model, providing the importance of individual features and insights into the model\u2019s decision-making process. Experimental results show that our approach improves prediction accuracy by 3.5% compared to existing methods.",

Ting Luo, Jing Zhang, Yingwei Qiu, Li Zhang, Yaohua Hu, Zhuliang Yu, Zhen Liang. IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Emotion decoding using Electroencephalography (EEG)-based affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) is crucial for affective computing but is hindered by EEG's non-stationarity, individual variability, and the high cost of large-scale labeled data. Deep learning-based approaches, while effective, require substantial computational resources and large datasets, limiting their practicality. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-based Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution (M3D), a lightweight non-deep transfer learning framework. M3D includes four main modules: manifold feature transformation, dynamic distribution alignment, classifier learning, and ensemble learning. The data undergoes a transformation onto an optimal Grassmann manifold space, enabling dynamic alignment of the source and target domains. This process prioritizes both marginal and conditional distributions according to their significance, ensuring enhanced adaptation efficiency across various types of data. In the classifier learning, the principle of structural risk minimization is integrated to develop robust classification models. This is complemented by dynamic distribution alignment, which refines the classifier iteratively. Additionally, the ensemble learning module aggregates the classifiers obtained at different stages of the optimization process, which leverages the diversity of the classifiers to enhance the overall prediction accuracy. The proposed M3D framework is evaluated on three benchmark EEG emotion recognition datasets using two validation protocols (cross-subject single-session and cross-subject cross-session), as well as on a clinical EEG dataset of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Experimental results demonstrate that M3D outperforms traditional non-deep learning methods, achieving an average improvement of 6.67%, while achieving deep learning-comparable performance with significantly lower data and computational requirements. These findings highlight the potential of M3D to enhance the practicality and applicability of aBCIs in real-world scenarios.",

Cyber .., 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: A main goal of heterogeneous transfer learning algorithms is to solve the domain adaptation problem of different feature spaces. However, some existing heterogeneous transfer learning methods usually only extract common features from the source domain and target domain, ignoring specific features, which may damage the performance of transfer learning. Therefore, a hierarchical filter transfer learning algorithm (HFTLA) for heterogeneous domains in is proposed. First, a nonlinear mapping is constructed to learn the potential relationship between the features of different domains. Then, the feature space can be aligned by learning common features and specific features, which can ensure the integrity of the features. Second, a hierarchical filter framework is developed to play different roles in different stages of transfer learning. In the pretransfer phase, a knowledge filter based on genetic principle is designed to increase the diversity of knowledge with different genetic operators. In the post-transfer phase, a guided filter is established to achieve a coupling balance between source knowledge and target information. Finally, experimental results on heterogeneous domains illustrate the effectiveness of HFTLA."
