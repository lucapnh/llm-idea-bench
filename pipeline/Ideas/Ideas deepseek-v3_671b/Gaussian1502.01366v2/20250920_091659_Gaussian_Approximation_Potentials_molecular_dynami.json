Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2016.\nNumber of citations: 112\nAbstract: We introduce a computational framework that is able to describe general many-body coarse-grained (CG) interactions of molecules and use it to model the free energy surface of molecular liquids as a cluster expansion in terms of monomer, dimer, and trimer terms. The contributions to the free energy due to these terms are inferred from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) data using Gaussian Approximation Potentials, a type of machine-learning model that employs Gaussian process regression. The resulting CG model is much more accurate than those possible using pair potentials. Though slower than the latter, our model can still be faster than all-atom simulations for solvent-free CG models commonly used in biomolecular simulations.",
        "2": "Gaussian approximation potential for studying the thermal conductivity of silicene. Cunzhi Zhang, Qiang Sun. Journal of Applied Physics, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 27\nAbstract: Due to the compatibility with the well-developed Si-based semiconductor technology, the properties of silicene and silicene-based materials have attracted tremendous attention. Among them, the thermal conductivity (TC) is of special importance for electronic devices. However, unlike graphene, the poor quality of empirical potentials hinders the reliable evaluation of TC for silicene using molecular dynamics (MD). Here, we present a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for silicene based on ab initio derived training data. The potential can precisely describe the geometries, mechanical properties, as well as phonon dispersion of free-standing sheet, outperforming any other empirical ones. Using sinusoidal approach-to-equilibrium MD simulations based on the GAP potential, the TC of silicene is found to be 32.4 \u00b1 2.9 W / m K at room temperature. Importantly, our result achieves a good agreement with Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) based first-principles predictions ( \u223c 30 W / m K), such that the TC value of silicene is confirmed via both MD and BTE; thus, we prove that the accuracy of machine learning potentials, like GAP, can enable a faithful prediction of TC at a density functional theory (DFT) level.Due to the compatibility with the well-developed Si-based semiconductor technology, the properties of silicene and silicene-based materials have attracted tremendous attention.

Boechi, D. Estrin, M. Sued, Mehrnoosh Arrar. Chemical Biology and Drug Design, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 25\nAbstract: The calculation of free energy profiles is central in understanding differential enzymatic activity, for instance, involving chemical reactions that require QM\u2010MM tools, ligand migration, and conformational rearrangements that can be modeled using classical potentials. The use of steered molecular dynamics (sMD) together with the Jarzynski equality is a popular approach in calculating free energy profiles. Here, we first briefly review the application of the Jarzynski equality to sMD simulations, then revisit the so\u2010called stiff\u2010spring approximation and the consequent expectation of Gaussian work distributions and, finally, reiterate the practical utility of the second\u2010order cumulant expansion, as it coincides with the parametric maximum\u2010likelihood estimator in this scenario. We illustrate this procedure using simulations of CO, both in aqueous solution and in a carbon nanotube as a model system for biologically relevant nanoheterogeneous environments. We conclude the use of the second\u2010order cumulant expansion permits the use of faster pulling velocities in sMD simulations, without introducing bias due to large dispersion in the non\u2010equilibrium work distribution.",

Nanoscale, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Two-dimensional materials (2DMs) continue to attract a lot of attention, particularly for their extreme flexibility and superior thermal properties. Molecular dynamics simulations are among the most powerful methods for computing these properties, but their reliability depends on the accuracy of interatomic interactions. While first principles approaches provide the most accurate description of interatomic forces, they are computationally expensive. In contrast, classical force fields are computationally efficient, but have limited accuracy in interatomic force description. Machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Gaussian Approximation Potentials, trained on density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer a compromise by providing both accurate estimation and computational efficiency. In this work, we present a systematic procedure to develop Gaussian approximation potentials for selected 2DMs, graphene, buckled silicene, and h-XN (X = B, Al, and Ga, as binary compounds) structures. We validate our approach through calculations that require various levels of accuracy in interatomic interactions. The calculated phonon dispersion curves and lattice thermal conductivity, obtained through harmonic and anharmonic force constants (including fourth order) are in excellent agreement with DFT results. HIPHIVE calculations, in which the generated GAP potentials were used to compute higher-order force constants instead of DFT, demonstrated the first-principles level accuracy of the potentials for interatomic force description. Molecular dynamics simulations based on phonon density of states calculations, which agree closely with DFT-based calculations, also show the success of the generated potentials in high-temperature simulations.",

Toussaint. Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: In this work, we study the damage in crystalline molybdenum material samples due to neutron bombardment in a primary knock-on atom (PKA) range of 0.5\u201310 keV at room temperature. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a previously derived machine learning (ML) interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework. We utilize a recently developed software workflow for fingerprinting and visualizing defects in damaged crystal structures to analyze the Mo samples with respect to the formation of point defects during and after a collision cascade. As a benchmark, we report results for the total number of Frenkel pairs (a self-interstitial atom and a single vacancy) formed and atom displacements as a function of the PKA energy. A comparison to results obtained using an embedded atom method (EAM) potential is presented to discuss the advantages and limits of the MD simulations utilizing ML-based potentials. The formation of Frenkel pairs follows a sublinear scaling law as \u03be b where b is a fitting parameter and \u03be = E PKA/E 0 with E 0 as a scaling factor. We found that the b = 0.54 for the GAP MD results and b = 0.667 for the EAM simulations. Although the average number of total defects is similar for both methods, the MD results show different atomic geometries for complex point defects, where the formation of crowdions by the GAP potential is closer to the DFT-based expectation. Finally, ion beam mixing results for GAP MD simulations are in a good agreement with experimental mixing efficiency data. This indicates that the modeling of atom relocation in cascades by machine learned potentials is suited to interpret the corresponding experimental findings.",

Supercomputing Frontiers and Innovations, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: The progress of supercomputer technologies initiated the development of methods of computational chemistry and their applications, particularly molecular dynamic simulations with ab initio potentials. These new methods allow to solve important problems of chemistry and technology. Particularly, solvent extraction and separation techniques are widely used to decrease the amount of radioactive wastes, especially radioactive caesium isotopes present in liquid phases. We demonstrated that the calculated binding constants between the alkali cation and calix[4]arene differ 10 times for Cs and Na ions, that is in good agreement with the experimental value. We report the results of benchmark calculations of our model system composed of 929 atoms described in the density functional theory approximation with the GGA-type functional PBE with the empirical dispersion correction D3 and combined basis of Gaussian functions and plane waves DZVP with Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotentials. We demonstrate that efficiency of calculations decrease to about half if the amount of nodes is 16 on the Lomonosov-2 supercomputer.",

Machine Learning: Science and Technology, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: Machine learning approaches have recently emerged as powerful tools to probe structure-property relationships in crystals and molecules. Specifically, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can accurately reproduce first-principles data at a cost similar to that of conventional interatomic potential approaches. While MLIPs have been extensively tested across various classes of materials and molecules, a clear characterization of the anharmonic terms encoded in the MLIPs is lacking. Here, we benchmark popular MLIPs using the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian of ThO2 in the fluorite crystal structure, which was constructed from density functional theory (DFT) using our highly accurate and efficient irreducible derivative methods. The anharmonic Hamiltonian was used to generate molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, which were used to train three classes of MLIPs: Gaussian approximation potentials, artificial neural networks (ANN), and graph neural networks (GNN). The results were assessed by directly comparing phonons and their interactions, as well as phonon linewidths, phonon lineshifts, and thermal conductivity. The models were also trained on a DFT MD dataset, demonstrating good agreement up to fifth-order for the ANN and GNN. Our analysis demonstrates that MLIPs have great potential for accurately characterizing anharmonicity in materials systems at a fraction of the cost of conventional first principles-based approaches.",

Yasushi Nara, Asanosuke Jinno, Koichi Murase. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: We present a new formulation for the mean-field propagation part of the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics, simulating an $N$-body system of interacting Gaussian wave packets via Lorentz scalar and vector potentials. Covariant equations of motion are derived based on the principle of least action. These covariant equations of motion can be solved with a computational cost comparable to that of conventional noncovariant quantum molecular dynamics. Furthermore, the new equations of motion accurately estimate the density-dependent potential, as demonstrated through comparison of the forces with the numerical integration. We apply them to $N$-body systems interacting via the Skyrme-type potentials or the relativistic mean field to simulate heavy-ion collisions. Our results show that the derived equations of motion provide a robust approximation to the dynamics of the full numerical integrations.",

Aaron Flototto, Benjamin Spetzler, Rose von Stackelberg, Martin Ziegler, Erich Runge, Christian Dre\u00dfler. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The formation of extended sulfur vacancies in MoS2 monolayers is closely associated with catalytic activity and may also be the basis for its memristive behavior. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) reveal key mechanisms of cooperative vacancy transport, including incorporation of vacancies into clusters of arbitrary size. The simulations provide a coherent atomistic explanation for irradiation-induced vacancy patterns observed experimentally, especially the formation of line defects spanning tens of nanometers. Results and performance are compared of two MLIP frameworks: (i) on-the-fly learning with Gaussian approximation potential, and (ii) fine-tuning of an equivariant foundation model."
