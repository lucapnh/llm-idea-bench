Chemical Reviews, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 759\nAbstract: We provide an introduction to Gaussian process regression (GPR) machine-learning methods in computational materials science and chemistry. The focus of the present review is on the regression of atomistic properties: in particular, on the construction of interatomic potentials, or force fields, in the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) framework; beyond this, we also discuss the fitting of arbitrary scalar, vectorial, and tensorial quantities. Methodological aspects of reference data generation, representation, and regression, as well as the question of how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically discussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions in chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in the field. A vision is outlined for the development of the methodology in the years to come.",

Caro, Albert P. Bart'ok. Journal of Chemical Physics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 40\nAbstract: Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAPs) are a class of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials routinely used to model materials and molecular systems on the atomic scale. The software implementation provides the means for both fitting models using ab\u00a0initio data and using the resulting potentials in atomic simulations. Details of the GAP theory, algorithms and software are presented, together with detailed usage examples to help new and existing users. We review some recent developments to the GAP framework, including Message Passing Interface parallelisation of the fitting code enabling its use on thousands of central processing unit cores and compression of descriptors to eliminate the poor scaling with the number of different chemical elements.",
        "3": "A comprehensive assessment of empirical potentials for carbon materials. Cheng-gen Qian, Ben Mclean, D. Hedman, F. Ding. APL Materials, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 38\nAbstract: Carbon materials and their unique properties have been extensively studied by molecular dynamics, thanks to the wide range of available carbon bond order potentials (CBOPs). Recently, with the increase in popularity of machine learning (ML), potentials such as Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), trained using ML, can accurately predict results for carbon. However, selecting the right potential is crucial as each performs differently for different carbon allotropes, and these differences can lead to inaccurate results. This work compares the widely used CBOPs and the GAP-20 ML potential with density functional theory results, including lattice constants, cohesive energies, defect formation energies, van der Waals interactions, thermal stabilities, and mechanical properties for different carbon allotropes. We find that GAP-20 can more accurately predict the structure, defect properties, and formation energies for a variety of crystalline phase carbon compared to CBOPs. Importantly, GAP-20 can simulate the thermal stability of C60 and the fracture of carbon nanotubes and graphene accurately, where CBOPs struggle. However, similar to CBOPs, GAP-20 is unable to accurately account for van der Waals interactions. Despite this, we find that GAP-20 outperforms all CBOPs assessed here and is at present the most suitable potential for studying thermal and mechanical properties for pristine and defective carbon.",

Journal of Applied Physics, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 27\nAbstract: Due to the compatibility with the well-developed Si-based semiconductor technology, the properties of silicene and silicene-based materials have attracted tremendous attention. Among them, the thermal conductivity (TC) is of special importance for electronic devices. However, unlike graphene, the poor quality of empirical potentials hinders the reliable evaluation of TC for silicene using molecular dynamics (MD). Here, we present a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for silicene based on ab initio derived training data. The potential can precisely describe the geometries, mechanical properties, as well as phonon dispersion of free-standing sheet, outperforming any other empirical ones. Using sinusoidal approach-to-equilibrium MD simulations based on the GAP potential, the TC of silicene is found to be 32.4 \u00b1 2.9 W / m K at room temperature. Importantly, our result achieves a good agreement with Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) based first-principles predictions ( \u223c 30 W / m K), such that the TC value of silicene is confirmed via both MD and BTE; thus, we prove that the accuracy of machine learning potentials, like GAP, can enable a faithful prediction of TC at a density functional theory (DFT) level.Due to the compatibility with the well-developed Si-based semiconductor technology, the properties of silicene and silicene-based materials have attracted tremendous attention.

Maresca. npj Computational Materials, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 26\nAbstract: The prediction of atomistic fracture mechanisms in body-centred cubic (bcc) iron is essential for understanding its semi-brittle nature. Existing atomistic simulations of the crack-tip under mode-I loading based on empirical interatomic potentials yield contradicting predictions and artificial mechanisms. To enable fracture prediction with quantum accuracy, we develop a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) using an active learning strategy by extending a density functional theory (DFT) database of ferromagnetic bcc iron. We apply the active learning algorithm and obtain a Fe GAP model with a converged model uncertainty over a broad range of stress intensity factors (SIFs) and for four crack systems. The learning efficiency of the approach is analysed, and the predicted critical SIFs are compared with Griffith and Rice theories. The simulations reveal that cleavage along the original crack plane is the atomistic fracture mechanism for {100} and {110} crack planes at T\u2009=\u20090\u2009K, thus settling a long-standing issue. Our work also highlights the need for a multiscale approach to predicting fracture and intrinsic ductility, whereby finite temperature, finite loading rate effects and pre-existing defects (e.g., nanovoids, dislocations) should be taken explicitly into account.",

Jakob Timmermann, Yonghyuk Lee, Carsten G. Staacke, Johannes T. Margraf, C. Scheurer, K. Reuter. Journal of Chemical Physics, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 22\nAbstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials, such as Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAPs), constitute a powerful class of surrogate models to computationally involved first-principles calculations. At a similar predictive quality but significantly reduced cost, they could leverage otherwise barely tractable extensive sampling as in global surface structure determination (SSD). This efficiency is jeopardized though, if an a priori unknown structural and chemical search space as in SSD requires an excessive number of first-principles data for the GAP training. To this end, we present a general and data-efficient iterative training protocol that blends the creation of new training data with the actual surface exploration process. Demonstrating this protocol with the SSD of low-index facets of rutile IrO2 and RuO2, the involved simulated annealing on the basis of the refining GAP identifies a number of unknown terminations even in the restricted sub-space of (1 \u00d7 1) surface unit cells. Particularly in an O-poor environment, some of these, then metal-rich terminations, are thermodynamically most stable and are reminiscent of complexions as discussed for complex ceramic materials.",

PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 17\nAbstract: Hydrogenation of amorphous silicon ( a -Si : H) is critical for reducing defect densities, passivating midgap states and surfaces, and improving photoconductivity in silicon-based electro-optical devices. Modeling the atomic-scale structure of this material is critical to understanding these processes, which in turn is needed to describe c -Si / a -Si : H heterojunctions that are at the heart of modern solar cells with world-record ef\ufb01ciency. Density functional theory (DFT) studies achieve the required high accuracy but are limited to moderate system sizes of 100 atoms or so by their high computational cost. Simulations of amorphous materials have been hindered by this high cost because large structural models are required to capture the medium-range order that is characteristic of such materials. Empirical potential models are much faster, but their accuracy is not suf\ufb01cient to correctly describe the frustrated local structure. Data-driven, machine-learned interatomic potentials have broken this impasse and have been highly successful in describing a variety of amorphous materials in their elemental phase. Here, we extend the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for silicon by incorporating the interaction with hydrogen, thereby signi\ufb01cantly improving the degree of realism with which amorphous silicon can be modeled. We show that our Si : H GAP enables the simulation of hydrogenated silicon with an accuracy very close to DFT but with computational expense and run times reduced by several orders of magnitude for large structures. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Si : H GAP by creating models of hydrogenated liquid and amorphous silicon and showing that their energies, forces, and stresses are in excellent agreement with DFT results, and their structure as captured by bond and angle distributions are in agreement with both DFT and experiments.",

Nanoscale, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Two-dimensional materials (2DMs) continue to attract a lot of attention, particularly for their extreme flexibility and superior thermal properties. Molecular dynamics simulations are among the most powerful methods for computing these properties, but their reliability depends on the accuracy of interatomic interactions. While first principles approaches provide the most accurate description of interatomic forces, they are computationally expensive. In contrast, classical force fields are computationally efficient, but have limited accuracy in interatomic force description. Machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Gaussian Approximation Potentials, trained on density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer a compromise by providing both accurate estimation and computational efficiency. In this work, we present a systematic procedure to develop Gaussian approximation potentials for selected 2DMs, graphene, buckled silicene, and h-XN (X = B, Al, and Ga, as binary compounds) structures. We validate our approach through calculations that require various levels of accuracy in interatomic interactions. The calculated phonon dispersion curves and lattice thermal conductivity, obtained through harmonic and anharmonic force constants (including fourth order) are in excellent agreement with DFT results. HIPHIVE calculations, in which the generated GAP potentials were used to compute higher-order force constants instead of DFT, demonstrated the first-principles level accuracy of the potentials for interatomic force description. Molecular dynamics simulations based on phonon density of states calculations, which agree closely with DFT-based calculations, also show the success of the generated potentials in high-temperature simulations.",

Toussaint. Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: In this work, we study the damage in crystalline molybdenum material samples due to neutron bombardment in a primary knock-on atom (PKA) range of 0.5\u201310 keV at room temperature. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a previously derived machine learning (ML) interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework. We utilize a recently developed software workflow for fingerprinting and visualizing defects in damaged crystal structures to analyze the Mo samples with respect to the formation of point defects during and after a collision cascade. As a benchmark, we report results for the total number of Frenkel pairs (a self-interstitial atom and a single vacancy) formed and atom displacements as a function of the PKA energy. A comparison to results obtained using an embedded atom method (EAM) potential is presented to discuss the advantages and limits of the MD simulations utilizing ML-based potentials. The formation of Frenkel pairs follows a sublinear scaling law as \u03be b where b is a fitting parameter and \u03be = E PKA/E 0 with E 0 as a scaling factor. We found that the b = 0.54 for the GAP MD results and b = 0.667 for the EAM simulations. Although the average number of total defects is similar for both methods, the MD results show different atomic geometries for complex point defects, where the formation of crowdions by the GAP potential is closer to the DFT-based expectation. Finally, ion beam mixing results for GAP MD simulations are in a good agreement with experimental mixing efficiency data. This indicates that the modeling of atom relocation in cascades by machine learned potentials is suited to interpret the corresponding experimental findings.",
