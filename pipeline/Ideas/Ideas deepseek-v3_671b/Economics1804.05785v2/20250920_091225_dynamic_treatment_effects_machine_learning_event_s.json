        "1": "Evaluating (weighted) dynamic treatment effects by double machine learning.. Hugo Bodory, M. Huber, Luk'avs Laff'ers. , 2020.\nNumber of citations: 60\nAbstract: We consider evaluating the causal effects of dynamic treatments, i.e. of multiple treatment sequences in various periods, based on double machine learning to control for observed, time-varying covariates in a data-driven way under a selection-on-observables assumption. To this end, we make use of so-called Neyman-orthogonal score functions, which imply the robustness of treatment effect estimation to moderate (local) misspecifications of the dynamic outcome and treatment models. This robustness property permits approximating outcome and treatment models by double machine learning even under high dimensional covariates and is combined with data splitting to prevent overfitting. In addition to effect estimation for the total population, we consider weighted estimation that permits assessing dynamic treatment effects in specific subgroups, e.g. among those treated in the first treatment period. We demonstrate that the estimators are asymptotically normal and $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent under specific regularity conditions and investigate their finite sample properties in a simulation study. Finally, we apply the methods to the Job Corps study in order to assess different sequences of training programs under a large set of covariates.",

Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 37\nAbstract: We consider the estimation of treatment effects in settings when multiple treatments are assigned over time and treatments can have a causal effect on future outcomes. We formulate the problem as a linear state space Markov process with a high dimensional state and propose an extension of the double/debiased machine learning framework to estimate the dynamic effects of treatments. Our method allows the use of arbitrary machine learning methods to control for the high dimensional state, subject to a mean square error guarantee, while still allowing parametric estimation and construction of confidence intervals for the dynamic treatment effect parameters of interest. Our method is based on a sequential regression peeling process, which we show can be equivalently interpreted as a Neyman orthogonal moment estimator. This allows us to show root-n asymptotic normality of the estimated causal effects.",
        "3": "Automatic Debiased Machine Learning for Dynamic Treatment Effects. Rahul Singh, Vasilis Syrgkanis. arXiv.org, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 14\nAbstract: We extend the idea of automated debiased machine learning to the dynamic treatment regime and more generally to nested functionals. We show that the multiply robust formula for the dynamic treatment regime with discrete treatments can be re-stated in terms of a recursive Riesz representer characterization of nested mean regressions. We then apply a recursive Riesz representer estimation learning algorithm that estimates de-biasing corrections without the need to characterize how the correction terms look like, such as for instance, products of inverse probability weighting terms, as is done in prior work on doubly robust estimation in the dynamic regime. Our approach defines a sequence of loss minimization problems, whose minimizers are the mulitpliers of the de-biasing correction, hence circumventing the need for solving auxiliary propensity models and directly optimizing for the mean squared error of the target de-biasing correction. We provide further applications of our approach to estimation of dynamic discrete choice models and estimation of long-term effects with surrogates.",

Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: Observational cohort studies are increasingly being used for comparative effectiveness research to assess the safety of therapeutics. Recently, various doubly robust methods have been proposed for average treatment effect estimation by combining the treatment model and the outcome model via different vehicles, such as matching, weighting, and regression. The key advantage of doubly robust estimators is that they require either the treatment model or the outcome model to be correctly specified to obtain a consistent estimator of average treatment effects, and therefore lead to a more accurate and often more precise inference. However, little work has been done to understand how doubly robust estimators differ due to their unique strategies of using the treatment and outcome models and how machine learning techniques can be combined to boost their performance, which we call double machine learning estimators. Here, we examine multiple popular doubly robust methods and compare their performance using different treatment and outcome modeling via extensive simulations and a real-world application. We found that incorporating machine learning with doubly robust estimators such as the targeted maximum likelihood estimator gives the best overall performance. Practical guidance on how to apply doubly robust estimators is provided.",

Puri, Wallace Akerley, Jincheng Shen. Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: Observational data (e.g. electronic health records) has become increasingly important in evidence-based research on dynamic treatment regimes, which tailor treatments over time to patients based on their characteristics and evolving clinical history. It is of great interest for clinicians and statisticians to identify an optimal dynamic treatment regime that can produce the best expected clinical outcome for each individual and thus maximize the treatment benefit over the population. Observational data impose various challenges for using statistical tools to estimate optimal dynamic treatment regimes. Notably, the task becomes more sophisticated when the clinical outcome of primary interest is time-to-event. Here, we propose a matching-based machine learning method to identify the optimal dynamic treatment regime with time-to-event outcomes subject to right-censoring using electronic health record data. In contrast to the established inverse probability weighting-based dynamic treatment regime methods, our proposed approach provides better protection against model misspecification and extreme weights in the context of treatment sequences, effectively addressing a prevalent challenge in the longitudinal analysis of electronic health record data. In simulations, the proposed method demonstrates robust performance across a range of scenarios. In addition, we illustrate the method with an application to estimate optimal dynamic treatment regimes for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer using a real-world, nationwide electronic health record database from Flatiron Health.",
        "6": "Multi-Study R-Learner for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Across Studies Using Statistical Machine Learning. Cathy Shyr, Boyu Ren, Prasad Patil, G. Parmigiani. , 2023.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) is crucial for precision medicine. While multiple studies can improve the generalizability of results, leveraging them for estimation is statistically challenging. Existing approaches often assume identical HTEs across studies, but this may be violated due to various sources of between-study heterogeneity, including differences in study design, study populations, and data collection protocols, among others. To this end, we propose a framework for multi-study HTE estimation that accounts for between-study heterogeneity in the nuisance functions and treatment effects. Our approach, the multi-study R-learner, extends the R-learner to obtain principled statistical estimation with machine learning (ML) in the multi-study setting. It involves a data-adaptive objective function that links study-specific treatment effects with nuisance functions through membership probabilities, which enable information to be borrowed across potentially heterogeneous studies. The multi-study R-learner framework can combine data from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or a combination of both. It's easy to implement and flexible in its ability to incorporate ML for estimating HTEs, nuisance functions, and membership probabilities. In the series estimation framework, we show that the multi-study R-learner is asymptotically normal and more efficient than the R-learner when there is between-study heterogeneity in the propensity score model under homoscedasticity. We illustrate using cancer data that the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing approaches in the presence of between-study heterogeneity.",

Julia Hatamyar, Noemi Kreif, Rudi Rocha, Martin Huber. , 2023.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: We combine two recently proposed nonparametric difference-in-differences methods, extending them to enable the examination of treatment effect heterogeneity in the staggered adoption setting using machine learning. The proposed method, machine learning difference-in-differences (MLDID), allows for estimation of time-varying conditional average treatment effects on the treated, which can be used to conduct detailed inference on drivers of treatment effect heterogeneity. We perform simulations to evaluate the performance of MLDID and find that it accurately identifies the true predictors of treatment effect heterogeneity. We then use MLDID to evaluate the heterogeneous impacts of Brazil's Family Health Program on infant mortality, and find those in poverty and urban locations experienced the impact of the policy more quickly than other subgroups.",
        "8": "Machine Learning Methods to Estimate Individualized Treatment Effects for Use in Health Technology Assessment. Yingying Zhang, Noemi Kreif, Vijay S Gc, Andrea Manca. Medical decision making, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Background Recent developments in causal inference and machine learning (ML) allow for the estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs), which reveal whether treatment effectiveness varies according to patients\u2019 observed covariates. ITEs can be used to stratify health policy decisions according to individual characteristics and potentially achieve greater population health. Little is known about the appropriateness of available ML methods for use in health technology assessment. Methods In this scoping review, we evaluate ML methods available for estimating ITEs, aiming to help practitioners assess their suitability in health technology assessment. We present a taxonomy of ML approaches, categorized by key challenges in health technology assessment using observational data, including handling time-varying confounding and time-to event data and quantifying uncertainty. Results We found a wide range of algorithms for simpler settings with baseline confounding and continuous or binary outcomes. Not many ML algorithms can handle time-varying or unobserved confounding, and at the time of writing, no ML algorithm was capable of estimating ITEs for time-to-event outcomes while accounting for time-varying confounding. Many of the ML algorithms that estimate ITEs in longitudinal settings do not formally quantify uncertainty around the point estimates. Limitations This scoping review may not cover all relevant ML methods and algorithms as they are continuously evolving. Conclusions Existing ML methods available for ITE estimation are limited in handling important challenges posed by observational data when used for cost-effectiveness analysis, such as time-to-event outcomes, time-varying and hidden confounding, or the need to estimate sampling uncertainty around the estimates. Implications ML methods are promising but need further development before they can be used to estimate ITEs for health technology assessments. Highlights Estimating individualized treatment effects (ITEs) using observational data and machine learning (ML) can support personalized treatment advice and help deliver more customized information on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health technologies. ML methods for ITE estimation are mostly designed for handling confounding at baseline but not time-varying or unobserved confounding. The few models that account for time-varying confounding are designed for continuous or binary outcomes, not time-to-event outcomes. Not all ML methods for estimating ITEs can quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. Future work on developing ML that addresses the concerns summarized in this review is needed before these methods can be widely used in clinical and health technology assessment\u2013like decision making.",
