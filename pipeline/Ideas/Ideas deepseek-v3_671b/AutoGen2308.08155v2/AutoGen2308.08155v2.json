This proposal builds on these insights by combining cost-effective communication with robust defenses against adversarial prompts.",
        "Abstract": "Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in solving complex tasks through collaboration. However, they often suffer from high token costs and vulnerability to adversarial attacks like prompt injection. We propose a novel framework that integrates lightweight message pruning techniques with robust security mechanisms to mitigate these issues. Our approach reduces communication overhead while ensuring resilience against malicious prompts, enabling scalable and secure multi-agent applications. Experiments on benchmarks in coding, QA, and decision-making tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in balancing performance, cost, and security.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "By leveraging a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in different aspects of task decomposition and problem-solving, we can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of complex tasks that are currently challenging for single-agent LLMs.",
        "Related Work": "Recent work like AutoGen and DrugAgent has demonstrated the potential of multi-agent systems in various domains.

Our proposal builds on these foundations by introducing a systematic framework for task decomposition and agent collaboration to enhance problem-solving capabilities.",
        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel multi-agent system designed specifically for complex task decomposition and problem solving using Large Language Models (LLMs). Each agent in the system is specialized in different aspects of task analysis, such as identifying subtasks, prioritizing tasks based on dependencies, and executing specific actions. The framework allows agents to dynamically collaborate and adapt their strategies based on real-time feedback and changing task requirements. We hypothesize that this structured approach will lead to more efficient and effective problem-solving compared to existing single-agent or loosely coordinated multi-agent systems. Empirical evaluations across various domains such as coding, mathematical problems, and decision-making tasks demonstrate the system's effectiveness in handling complex scenarios.",
