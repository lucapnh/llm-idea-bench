European Conference on Computer Vision, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 461\nAbstract: We introduce Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), a novel training approach that efficiently samples large-scale foundational image diffusion models in just 1-4 steps while maintaining high image quality. We use score distillation to leverage large-scale off-the-shelf image diffusion models as a teacher signal in combination with an adversarial loss to ensure high image fidelity even in the low-step regime of one or two sampling steps. Our analyses show that our model clearly outperforms existing few-step methods (GANs, Latent Consistency Models) in a single step and reaches the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models (SDXL) in only four steps. ADD is the first method to unlock single-step, real-time image synthesis with foundation models.

International Conference on Learning Representations, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 215\nAbstract: Consistency models are a nascent family of generative models that can sample high quality data in one step without the need for adversarial training. Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. Additionally, we introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations. Combined with better hyperparameter tuning, these modifications enable consistency models to achieve FID scores of 2.51 and 3.25 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\\times 64$ respectively in a single sampling step. These scores mark a 3.5$\\times$ and 4$\\times$ improvement compared to prior consistency training approaches. Through two-step sampling, we further reduce FID scores to 2.24 and 2.77 on these two datasets, surpassing those obtained via distillation in both one-step and two-step settings, while narrowing the gap between consistency models and other state-of-the-art generative models.",
        "3": "Consistency Models Made Easy. Zhengyang Geng, Ashwini Pokle, William Luo, Justin Lin, J. Z. Kolter. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 46\nAbstract: Consistency models (CMs) offer faster sampling than traditional diffusion models, but their training is resource-intensive. For example, as of 2024, training a state-of-the-art CM on CIFAR-10 takes one week on 8 GPUs. In this work, we propose an effective scheme for training CMs that largely improves the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pretrained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly reduced training times while improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained for hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling laws of CMs under ECT, showing that they obey the classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales. Our code (https://github.com/locuslab/ect) is publicly available, making CMs more accessible to the broader community.",
        "4": "Multistep Consistency Models. J. Heek, Emiel Hoogeboom, Tim Salimans. arXiv.org, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 43\nAbstract: Diffusion models are relatively easy to train but require many steps to generate samples. Consistency models are far more difficult to train, but generate samples in a single step. In this paper we propose Multistep Consistency Models: A unification between Consistency Models (Song et al., 2023) and TRACT (Berthelot et al., 2023) that can interpolate between a consistency model and a diffusion model: a trade-off between sampling speed and sampling quality. Specifically, a 1-step consistency model is a conventional consistency model whereas a $\\infty$-step consistency model is a diffusion model. Multistep Consistency Models work really well in practice. By increasing the sample budget from a single step to 2-8 steps, we can train models more easily that generate higher quality samples, while retaining much of the sampling speed benefits. Notable results are 1.4 FID on Imagenet 64 in 8 step and 2.1 FID on Imagenet128 in 8 steps with consistency distillation, using simple losses without adversarial training. We also show that our method scales to a text-to-image diffusion model, generating samples that are close to the quality of the original model.",

Lin, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Chung-Ching Lin, David S. Doermann, Junsong Yuan, Lijuan Wang. Neural Information Processing Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 16\nAbstract: Image diffusion distillation achieves high-fidelity generation with very few sampling steps. However, applying these techniques directly to video diffusion often results in unsatisfactory frame quality due to the limited visual quality in public video datasets. This affects the performance of both teacher and student video diffusion models. Our study aims to improve video diffusion distillation while improving frame appearance using abundant high-quality image data. We propose motion consistency model (MCM), a single-stage video diffusion distillation method that disentangles motion and appearance learning. Specifically, MCM includes a video consistency model that distills motion from the video teacher model, and an image discriminator that enhances frame appearance to match high-quality image data. This combination presents two challenges: (1) conflicting frame learning objectives, as video distillation learns from low-quality video frames while the image discriminator targets high-quality images; and (2) training-inference discrepancies due to the differing quality of video samples used during training and inference. To address these challenges, we introduce disentangled motion distillation and mixed trajectory distillation. The former applies the distillation objective solely to the motion representation, while the latter mitigates training-inference discrepancies by mixing distillation trajectories from both the low- and high-quality video domains. Extensive experiments show that our MCM achieves the state-of-the-art video diffusion distillation performance. Additionally, our method can enhance frame quality in video diffusion models, producing frames with high aesthetic scores or specific styles without corresponding video data.",

AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 10\nAbstract: The iterative sampling procedure employed by diffusion models (DMs) often leads to significant latency. To address this, we propose Stochastic Consistency Distillation (SCott) to enable accelerated text-to-image generation, where high-quality generations can be achieved with just 2-4 sampling steps or even1 step, and further improvements can be obtained by additional cost, e.g., 4 steps. In contrast to vanilla consistency distillation (CD) which distills the ordinary differential equation solvers-based sampling process of a pre-trained teacher model into a student, SCott explores the possibility and validates the efficacy of integrating stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers into CD to fully unleash the potential of the teacher. SCott is augmented with elaborate strategies to control the noise strength and sampling process of the SDE solver. An adversarial loss is further incorporated to strengthen the sample quality with rare sampling steps. Empirically, on the MSCOCO-2017 5K dataset with a Stable Diffusion-V1.5 teacher, SCott achieves an FID of 21.9, surpassing that of the 1-step InstaFlow (23.4) and the 4-step UFOGen (22.1). Moreover, SCott can yield more diverse samples than other consistency models for high-resolution image generation, with up to 16% improvement in a qualified metric.",

Xinyu Bai, Feng Xu. arXiv.org, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather, high-resolution imaging capabilities, but its unique imaging mechanism often requires expert interpretation, limiting its widespread applicability. Translating SAR images into more easily recognizable optical images using diffusion models helps address this challenge. However, diffusion models suffer from high latency due to numerous iterative inferences, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can achieve image translation with just a single iteration but often at the cost of image quality. To overcome these issues, we propose a new training framework for SAR-to-optical image translation that combines the strengths of both approaches. Our method employs consistency distillation to reduce iterative inference steps and integrates adversarial learning to ensure image clarity and minimize color shifts. Additionally, our approach allows for a trade-off between quality and speed, providing flexibility based on application requirements. We conducted experiments on SEN12 and GF3 datasets, performing quantitative evaluations using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), as well as calculating the inference latency. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inference speed by 131 times while maintaining the visual quality of the generated images, thus offering a robust and efficient solution for SAR-to-optical image translation.",

Shihao Chen, Yu Gu, Jianwei Cui, Jie Zhang, Rilin Chen, Lirong Dai. International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Any-to-any singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to transfer a target singer's timbre to other songs using a short voice sample. However many diffusion model based any-to-any SVC methods, which have achieved impressive results, usually suffered from low efficiency caused by a mass of inference steps. In this paper, we propose LCM-SVC, a latent consistency distillation (LCD) based latent diffusion model (LDM) to accelerate inference speed. We achieved one-step or few-step inference while maintaining the high performance by distilling a pretrained LDM based SVC model, which had the advantages of tim-bre decoupling and sound quality. Experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the inference time and largely preserve the sound quality and timbre similarity comparing with other state-of-the-art SVC models.

Izadi, Shuo Zhang. arXiv.org, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: In this work, we demonstrate the integration of a score-matching diffusion model into a deterministic architecture for time-domain musical source extraction, resulting in enhanced audio quality. To address the typically slow iterative sampling process of diffusion models, we apply consistency distillation and reduce the sampling process to a single step, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models, and with two or more steps, even surpassing them. Trained on the Slakh2100 dataset for four instruments (bass, drums, guitar, and piano), our model shows significant improvements across objective metrics compared to baseline methods.
