        "Short Hypothesis": "By integrating reasoning and acting processes more seamlessly within language models, we can enhance their decision-making capabilities across diverse tasks.",
        "Related Work": "Recent works like ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and LATS (Zhou et al., 2023) have explored synergizing reasoning and acting in language models. However, these approaches often treat reasoning and acting as separate processes or require complex frameworks like Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our proposal focuses on a simpler, more unified approach that dynamically interleaves reasoning and acting without heavy computational overhead.",
        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel framework for enhancing decision-making in language models by unifying reasoning and acting processes into a single, cohesive mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that treat these components separately or rely on complex search algorithms, our method dynamically interleaves reasoning traces with task-specific actions. This integration allows the model to generate more interpretable and efficient solutions across diverse tasks, such as question answering, interactive decision-making, and real-world problem-solving. We evaluate our framework on benchmarks like HotpotQA, ALFWorld, and WebShop, demonstrating improved success rates and reduced error propagation compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Related Work": "Existing approaches like ReAct and LATS have explored synergizing reasoning and acting in LLMs but focus on external tools or environment interactions. Our proposal uniquely leverages RL to optimize the internal process of interleaving reasoning steps directly within the model, distinguishing it from these methods by focusing on intrinsic efficiency and accuracy improvements.",
        "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to enhance large language models' (LLMs) capability in interleaved reasoning\u2014alternating between thinking and answering during multi-hop question tasks. Traditional chain-of-thought approaches, while effective, often lead to inefficiencies such as increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). By employing RL with a rule-based reward system that incentivizes correct intermediate steps, our approach not only reduces TTFT by over 80% but also improves accuracy in Pass@1 tests across diverse datasets. This method does not require external tools and demonstrates strong generalization to complex reasoning tasks like MATH and MMLU.",
