        "Short Hypothesis": "Extending the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) with nonlinear and non-Gaussian techniques can improve its performance in high-dimensional systems without significantly increasing computational cost.",
        "Related Work": "Existing research has explored various extensions of the EnKF, such as Gaussian anamorphosis methods and two-step updates like the Rank Histogram Filter (RHF). These approaches have shown promise but are limited by their reliance on specific assumptions or increased complexity. Recent work also highlights multifidelity extensions and deep learning-enhanced filters, which offer computational efficiency but require further validation in diverse scenarios.",
        "Abstract": "This proposal investigates novel nonlinear and non-Gaussian extensions to the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for high-dimensional systems. While EnKF is widely used due to its scalability, its Gaussian assumptions limit performance in complex settings. We propose a framework that integrates advanced techniques such as optimal transport-based updates and multifidelity control variates to address these limitations. The approach aims to maintain computational efficiency while improving accuracy in non-Gaussian scenarios. Experiments will focus on benchmark problems like the Lorenz-96 system, comparing the proposed extensions with existing methods (e.g., RHF and GA-EnKF) using metrics such as RMSE and computational cost.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Using adaptive sparsity in precision matrices for localization can improve the representation of correlation structures and reduce computational costs compared to traditional covariance or fixed-precision methods.",
        "Related Work": "Existing work includes model space localization (Lei et al., 2018), CNN-based adaptive localization (Wang et al., 2023), and precision localization (Gryvill & Tjelmeland, 2024). This proposal distinguishes itself by introducing adaptivity into the sparsity structure of precision matrices, which has not been explored in EnKF localization.",
        "Abstract": "Localization is a critical component of Ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKF) to mitigate sampling errors caused by limited ensemble sizes. While covariance and model space localizations are widely used, they often require domain-specific tuning or significant computational resources. This work proposes adaptive precision localization, where the sparsity structure of precision matrices is dynamically adjusted based on sample correlations between state variables. By leveraging sparse precision matrices, this approach aims to better capture correlation structures while reducing computational costs. Experiments will be conducted using the Lorenz-96 model and a high-dimensional geophysical system to evaluate its performance in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty representation, and scalability.",

        "Abstract": "This work proposes a novel framework for data assimilation in chaotic systems by integrating deep learning with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Traditional EnKF methods rely on large ensembles to estimate state covariances, which is computationally expensive. We hypothesize that a deep neural network can learn nonlinear relationships within the system dynamics, enabling accurate state estimation even with small or single-state ensembles. Our approach leverages residual convolutional networks to model chaotic behavior and identify key instabilities, reducing reliance on ensemble-based covariance estimates. Experiments will focus on the Lorenz 96 system as a benchmark for spatiotemporal chaos. We aim to demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to traditional EnKF while significantly lowering computational costs.",
