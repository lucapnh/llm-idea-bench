        "Short Hypothesis": "By dynamically selecting and reusing high-quality reasoning paths across multiple samples, we can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of self-consistency in language models without requiring additional training or supervision.",
        "Related Work": "Existing methods like Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2022) rely on generating multiple independent reasoning paths for each query, which is computationally expensive.

        "Short Hypothesis": "Self-consistency, when applied to few-shot learning scenarios with chain-of-thought prompting, can significantly improve reasoning accuracy and robustness by leveraging multiple diverse reasoning paths.",
        "Related Work": "Existing research on self-consistency primarily focuses on zero-shot or single-instance settings (Wang et al., 2022). Few-shot learning has been explored independently but not extensively combined with self-consistency. This proposal bridges this gap by investigating how self-consistency can enhance few-shot reasoning tasks, particularly in scenarios where limited labeled examples are available.",
        "Abstract": "Few-shot learning is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) when labeled data is scarce. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning performance but often suffers from inconsistency and variability in generated responses. This work proposes integrating self-consistency into few-shot CoT prompting to address these limitations. By sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer, we hypothesize that this approach will improve accuracy and robustness in few-shot learning tasks. We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, comparing it against standard few-shot CoT and zero-shot self-consistency baselines.",
