        "Short Hypothesis": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate more robust and executable plans when augmented with external verifiers that provide iterative feedback, addressing their limitations in autonomous plan generation.",
        "Related Work": "Existing work has shown that LLMs struggle with generating executable plans autonomously but can assist as heuristic guides. For example, 'On the Planning Abilities of Large Language Models' demonstrates that external verifiers improve plan quality by back-prompting LLMs. This proposal builds on this insight by formalizing a lightweight framework for iterative refinement.",
        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in heuristic planning but often fail to generate executable plans autonomously due to limitations in precise reasoning and validation. We propose a novel framework that integrates external verifiers with LLMs to iteratively refine generated plans, ensuring correctness and feasibility. The verifier provides feedback on plan errors, which is used to back-prompt the LLM for corrections. This iterative process continues until a valid plan is found or a maximum iteration limit is reached. Experiments are conducted on benchmark planning tasks (e.g., Blocks World, logistics) to evaluate the framework's effectiveness in improving plan quality and success rates compared to standalone LLMs.",

By constructing visual-textual graphs that align image or video content with textual descriptions, we aim to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in tasks requiring joint understanding of both modalities. The proposed framework will explicitly model relationships between visual and textual elements using graph structures, enabling more accurate and interpretable answers. We hypothesize that this approach will outperform existing methods in multi-modal QA benchmarks by leveraging structured representations of cross-modal dependencies.",

        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in complex reasoning tasks, but their performance often suffers from inefficient exploration of reasoning paths or redundant intermediate steps. We propose Adaptive Thought Refinement (ATR), a novel framework that dynamically refines intermediate reasoning steps based on confidence levels and semantic consistency. ATR first evaluates the confidence level of each step and then consolidates semantically identical paths to reduce redundancy. This approach not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances accuracy by focusing on high-confidence, semantically consistent solutions. We validate ATR on mathematical reasoning and commonsense reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both performance metrics compared to existing methods.",

Our proposal extends these ideas by explicitly integrating MCTS with LLMs to optimize exploration and exploitation in code generation tasks.",

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLMs, enabling systematic exploration of the solution space guided by execution-based feedback. Our approach leverages MCTS's ability to balance exploration and exploitation while incorporating heuristic evaluations from the environment to refine generated code iteratively.
