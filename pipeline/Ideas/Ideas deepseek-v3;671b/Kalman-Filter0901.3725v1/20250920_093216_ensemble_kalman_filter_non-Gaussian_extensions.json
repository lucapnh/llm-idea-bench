        "1": "The Ensemble Kalman filter: a signal processing perspective. Michael Roth, Gustaf Hendeby, C. Fritsche, F. Gustafsson. EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 82\nAbstract: The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a Monte Carlo-based implementation of the Kalman filter (KF) for extremely high-dimensional, possibly nonlinear, and non-Gaussian state estimation problems. Its ability to handle state dimensions in the order of millions has made the EnKF a popular algorithm in different geoscientific disciplines. Despite a similarly vital need for scalable algorithms in signal processing, e.g., to make sense of the ever increasing amount of sensor data, the EnKF is hardly discussed in our field. This self-contained review is aimed at signal processing researchers and provides all the knowledge to get started with the EnKF. The algorithm is derived in a KF framework, without the often encountered geoscientific terminology. Algorithmic challenges and required extensions of the EnKF are provided, as well as relations to sigma point KF and particle filters. The relevant EnKF literature is summarized in an extensive survey and unique simulation examples, including popular benchmark problems, complement the theory with practical insights. The signal processing perspective highlights new directions of research and facilitates the exchange of potentially beneficial ideas, both for the EnKF and high-dimensional nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering in general.",
        "2": "Kalman Filter and its Modern Extensions for the Continuous-time Nonlinear Filtering Problem. A. Taghvaei, J. Wiljes, P. Mehta, S. Reich. arXiv.org, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 46\nAbstract: This paper is concerned with the filtering problem in continuous-time. Three algorithmic solution approaches for this problem are reviewed: (i) the classical Kalman-Bucy filter which provides an exact solution for the linear Gaussian problem, (ii) the ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter (EnKBF) which is an approximate filter and represents an extension of the Kalman-Bucy filter to nonlinear problems, and (iii) the feedback particle filter (FPF) which represents an extension of the EnKBF and furthermore provides for an consistent solution in the general nonlinear, non-Gaussian case. The common feature of the three algorithms is the gain times error formula to implement the update step (to account for conditioning due to the observations) in the filter. In contrast to the commonly used sequential Monte Carlo methods, the EnKBF and FPF avoid the resampling of the particles in the importance sampling update step. Moreover, the feedback control structure provides for error correction potentially leading to smaller simulation variance and improved stability properties. The paper also discusses the issue of non-uniqueness of the filter update formula and formulates a novel approximation algorithm based on ideas from optimal transport and coupling of measures. Performance of this and other algorithms is illustrated for a numerical example.",

        "4": "A comparison of nonlinear extensions to the ensemble Kalman filter. Ian G. Grooms. Computational Geosciences, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 12\nAbstract: Ensemble Kalman filters are based on a Gaussian assumption, which can limit their performance in some non-Gaussian settings. This paper reviews two nonlinear, non-Gaussian extensions of the Ensemble Kalman Filter: Gaussian anamorphosis (GA) methods and two-step updates, of which the rank histogram filter (RHF) is a prototypical example. GA-EnKF methods apply univariate transforms to the state and observation variables to make their distribution more Gaussian before applying an EnKF. The two-step methods use a scalar Bayesian update for the first step, followed by linear regression for the second step. The connection of the two-step framework to the full Bayesian problem is made, which opens the door to more advanced two-step methods in the full Bayesian setting. A new method for the first part of the two-step framework is proposed, with a similar form to the RHF but a different motivation, called the \u2018improved RHF\u2019 (iRHF). A suite of experiments with the Lorenz-\u201896 model demonstrate situations where the GA-EnKF methods are similar to EnKF, and where they outperform EnKF. The experiments also strongly support the accuracy of the RHF and iRHF filters for nonlinear and non-Gaussian observations; these methods uniformly beat the EnKF and GA-EnKF methods in the experiments reported here. The new iRHF method is only more accurate than RHF at small ensemble sizes in the experiments reported here.",

Luque. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 10\nAbstract: Flood simulation and forecast capability have been greatly improved thanks to advances in data assimilation (DA) strategies incorporating various types of observations; many are derived from Earth Observations from space. This article focuses on the assimilation of 2-D flood observations derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired during a flood event with a dual state-parameter ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Resulting binary wet/dry maps are here expressed in terms of wet surface ratios (WSRs) over a number of subdomains of the floodplain. This ratio is assimilated jointly with in situ water-level observations to improve the flow dynamics within the floodplain. However, the non-Gaussianity of the observation errors associated with these SAR-derived measurements breaks a major hypothesis for the application of the EnKF, thus jeopardizing the optimality of the filter analysis. The novelty of this article lies in the treatment of the non-Gaussianity of the SAR-derived WSR observations with a Gaussian anamorphosis (GA) process. This DA strategy was validated and applied over the Garonne Marmandaise catchment (southwest of France) represented with a TELEMAC-2D hydrodynamic model, first in a twin experiment and then for a major flood event that occurred in January and February 2021. It was shown that assimilating SAR-derived WSR observations in complement to the in situ water-level observations significantly improves the representation of the flood dynamics. The GA process brings further improvement to the DA analysis while also demonstrating to be a nonessential element. This study heralds a reliable solution for flood forecasting over poorly gauged catchments thanks to available remote sensing datasets.",
        "6": "Derivation and Extensions of the Linear Feedback Particle Filter Based on Duality Formalisms. Jin-Won Kim, A. Taghvaei, P. Mehta. IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 5\nAbstract: This paper is concerned with a duality-based approach to derive the linear feedback particle filter (FPF). The FPF is a controlled interacting particle system where the control law is designed to provide an exact solution for the nonlinear filtering problem. For the linear Gaussian special case, certain simplifications arise whereby the linear FPF is identical to the square-root form of the ensemble Kalman filter. For this and for the more general nonlinear non-Gaussian case, it has been an open problem to derive/interpret the FPF control law as a solution of an optimal control problem. In this paper, certain duality-based arguments are employed to transform the filtering problem into an optimal control problem. Its solution is shown to yield the deterministic form of the linear FPF. An extension is described to incorporate stochastic effects due to noise leading to a novel homotopy of exact ensemble Kalman filters. All the derivations are based on duality formalisms.",

Heemink. Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 5\nAbstract: This work proposes a robust and non-Gaussian version of the shrinkage-based knowledge-aided EnKF implementation called Ensemble Time Local H\u221e Filter Knowledge-Aided (EnTLHF-KA). The EnTLHF-KA requires a target covariance matrix to integrate previously obtained information and knowledge directly into the data assimilation (DA). The proposed method is based on the robust H\u221e filter and on its ensemble time-local version the EnTLHF, using an adaptive inflation factor depending on the shrinkage covariance estimated matrix. This implies a theoretical and solid background to construct robust filters from the well-known covariance inflation technique. The proposed technique is implemented in a synthetic assimilation experiment, and in an air quality application using the LOTOS-EUROS model over the Aburr\u00e1 Valley to evaluate its potential for non-linear and non-Gaussian large systems. In the spatial distribution of the PM2.5 concentrations along the valley, the method outperforms the well-known Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), and the non-robust knowledge-aided Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF-KA). In contrast to the other simulations, the ability to issue warnings for high concentration events is also increased. Finally, the simulation using EnTLHF-KA has lower error values than using EnKF-KA, indicating the advantages of robust approaches in high uncertainty systems.",

        "9": "A competitive baseline for deep learning enhanced data assimilation using conditional Gaussian ensemble Kalman filtering. Zachariah Malik, R. Maulik. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional Gaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional multiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.",
