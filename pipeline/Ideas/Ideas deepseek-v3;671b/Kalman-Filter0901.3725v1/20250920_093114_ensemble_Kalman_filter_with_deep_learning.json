Finn, Charlotte Durand, Sibo Cheng, Yumeng Chen, I. Pasmans, A. Carrassi. Chaos, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: We investigate the ability to discover data assimilation (DA) schemes meant for chaotic dynamics with deep learning. The focus is on learning the analysis step of sequential DA, from state trajectories and their observations, using a simple residual convolutional neural network, while assuming the dynamics to be known. Experiments are performed with the Lorenz 96 dynamics, which display spatiotemporal chaos and for which solid benchmarks for DA performance exist. The accuracy of the states obtained from the learned analysis approaches that of the best possibly tuned ensemble Kalman filter and is far better than that of variational DA alternatives. Critically, this can be achieved while propagating even just a single state in the forecast step. We investigate the reason for achieving ensemble filtering accuracy without an ensemble. We diagnose that the analysis scheme actually identifies key dynamical perturbations, mildly aligned with the unstable subspace, from the forecast state alone, without any ensemble-based covariances representation. This reveals that the analysis scheme has learned some multiplicative ergodic theorem associated to the DA process seen as a non-autonomous random dynamical system.",

Ayodeji S. Ogundana, P. K. Terala, Migara Y Amarasinghe, Xuanchen Xiang, Simon Y. Foo. IEEE Access, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: Conventional model-based probabilistic inference methods require increasingly complex models to improve Electric Vehicle (EV) battery State of Charge (SOC) estimation. Deep learning methods gained popularity in recent years with their model free estimations. However, practical constraints such as insufficient training data, model complexity for real time implementation, and generalization on new dataset hinder performance reliability. Another major practical drawback of the data driven deep learning approach is its poor convergence from an unfamiliar initial error state as training dataset does not adequately accommodate these practical error scenarios. This paper proposes an ensemble method that uses a weighted estimate of the Central Difference Kalman Filter (CDKF) and Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) to accurately estimate SOC in the early stages of degradation. We employ a parallel ensemble estimation method that reduces the estimation bias, improves generalization, accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the estimator. We propose a pre-estimated voting weight to combine the ensemble algorithm and employ the CDKF covariance dependent method as the optimum approach for initializing the ensemble system to achieve a robust convergence performance. The state converges on an average of 136 time-steps when initialized halfway from the true state. The average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) performance of the ensemble method is about 0.5 % with an average training data of about 31,041 time-steps. The model was validated using conventional drive cycle data and was shown to outperform its individual ensemble members and gated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM).",

Walker, Ryan Ceresani, Dylan Spagnuolo, Christopher Guagliano, Henry Diaz, Jason C. Twedt. Security + Defence, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of situational awareness in military defense applications. With the growing use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs), MOT methods for aerial surveillance is in high demand. Application of MOT in UAS presents specific challenges such as moving sensor, changing zoom levels, dynamic background, illumination changes, obscurations and small objects. In this work, we present a robust object tracking architecture aimed to accommodate for the noise in real-time situations. Our work is based on the tracking-by-detection paradigm where an independent object detector is first applied to isolate all potential detections and an object tracking model is applied afterwards to link unique objects between frames. Object trajectories are constructed using multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) framework that produces the best hypothesis based on the kinematic and visual scorings. We propose a kinematic prediction model, called Deep Extended Kalman Filter (DeepEKF), in which a sequence-to-sequence architecture is used to predict entity trajectories in latent space. DeepEKF utilizes a learned image embedding along with an attention mechanism trained to weight the importance of areas in an image to predict future states. For the visual scoring, we experiment with different similarity measures to calculate distance based on entity appearances, including a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder, pre-trained using Siamese networks. In initial evaluation experiments, we show that our method, combining scoring structure of the kinematic and visual models within a MHT framework, has improved performance especially in edge cases where entity motion is unpredictable, or the data presents frames with significant gaps.",

Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: A deep learning (DL) model, based on a transformer architecture, is trained on a climate\u2010model data set and compared with a standard linear inverse model (LIM) in the tropical Pacific. We show that the DL model produces more accurate forecasts compared to the LIM when tested on a reanalysis data set. We then assess the ability of an ensemble Kalman filter to reconstruct the monthly averaged upper ocean from a noisy set of 24 sea\u2010surface temperature observations designed to mimic existing coral proxy measurements, and compare results for the DL model and LIM. Due to signal damping in the DL model, we implement a novel inflation technique by adding noise from hindcast experiments. Results show that assimilating observations with the DL model yields better reconstructions than the LIM for observation averaging times ranging from 1 month to 1 year. The improved reconstruction is due to the enhanced predictive capabilities of the DL model, which map the memory of past observations to future assimilation times.",

Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: This paper introduces a novel ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) that integrates a machine-learning approach. The conventional EAKF adopts linear and Gaussian assumptions, making it difficult to handle cross-component updates in strongly coupled data assimilation (SCDA). The new approach employs nonlinear variable relationships established by a deep neural network (DNN) during the analysis stage of the EAKF, which nonlinearly projects observation increments into the state variable space. It can diminish errors in estimating cross-component error covariance arising from insufficient ensemble members, therefore improving the SCDA analysis. A conceptual coupled model is employed in this paper to conduct twin experiments, validating the DNN\u2013EAKF\u2019s capability to outperform conventional EAKF in SCDA. The results reveal that the DNN\u2013EAKF can make SCDA superior to WCDA with a limited ensemble size. The root-mean-squared errors are reduced up to 70% while the anomaly correlation coefficients are increased up to 20% when the atmospheric observations are used to update the ocean variables directly. The other model components can also be improved through SCDA. This approach is anticipated to offer insights for future methodological integrations of machine learning and data assimilation and provide methods for SCDA applications in coupled general circulation models.",

Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional Gaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional multiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.",
