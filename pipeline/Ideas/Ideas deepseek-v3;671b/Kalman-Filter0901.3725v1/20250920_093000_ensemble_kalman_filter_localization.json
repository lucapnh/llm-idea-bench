        "2": "Improving Assimilation of Radiance Observations by Implementing Model Space Localization in an Ensemble Kalman Filter. L. Lei, J. Whitaker, C. Bishop. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 41\nAbstract: Experiments using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Finite\u2010Volume Cubed\u2010Sphere Dynamical Core Global Forecasting System (FV3GFS) reveal that the four\u2010dimensional ensemble\u2010variational method (4DEnVAR) performs similarly to an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) when no radiance observations are assimilated, but 4DEnVAR is superior to an EnKF when radiance observations are assimilated. The hypothesis for the cause of the differences between 4DEnVAR and EnKF is the difference in vertical localization, since radiance observations are integral observations in the vertical and 4DEnVAR uses model space localization while the EnKF uses observation space localization. A modulation approach, which generates an expanded ensemble from the raw ensemble and eigenvectors of the localization matrix, has been adopted to implement model space localization in the operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration EnKF. As constructed, the expanded ensemble is a square root of the vertically localized background error covariance matrix, so no explicit vertical localization is necessary during the EnKF update. The size of the expanded ensemble is proportional to the rank of the vertical localization matrix\u2014for a vertical localization scale of 1.5 (3.0) scale heights, 12 (7) eigenvectors explain 96% of the variance of the localization matrix, so the expanded ensemble is 12 (7) times larger than the raw ensemble. Results from assimilating only radiance observations in the FV3GFS model confirm that EnKF with model\u2010space vertical localization performs better than observation\u2010space localization, and produces results similar to 4DEnVAR. Moreover, a 960\u2010member ensemble is sufficient to turn off the vertical localization entirely and yields significant improvements comparing to an 80\u2010member ensemble with model space localization.",

Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: Flow\u2010dependent background error covariances estimated from short\u2010term ensemble forecasts suffer from sampling errors due to limited ensemble sizes. Covariance localization is often used to mitigate the sampling errors, especially for high dimensional geophysical applications. Most applied localization methods, empirical or adaptive ones, multiply the Kalman gain or background error covariances by a distance\u2010dependent parameter, which is a simple linear filtering model. Here two localization methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learning from paired data sets are proposed. The CNN\u2010based localization function (CLF) aims to minimize the sampling error of the estimated Kalman gain, and the CNN\u2010based empirical localization function (CELF) aims to minimize the posterior error of state variables. These two CNN\u2010based localization methods can provide localization functions that are nonlinear, spatially and temporally adaptive, and non\u2010symmetric with respect to displacement, without requiring any prior assumptions for the localization functions. Results using the Lorenz05 model show that CLF and CELF can better capture the structures of the Kalman gain than the best Gaspari and Cohn (GC) localization function and the adaptive reference localization method. For both perfect\u2010 and imperfect\u2010model experiments, CLF produces smaller errors of the Kalman gain, prior and posterior than the best GC and reference localization, especially for spatially averaged observations. Without model error, CELF has smaller prior and posterior errors than the best GC and reference localization for spatially averaged observations, while with model error, CELF has smaller prior and posterior errors than the best GC and reference localization for single\u2010point observations.",

Frontiers in Earth Science, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: One important aspect of successfully implementing an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in a high dimensional geophysical application is covariance localization. But for satellite radiances whose vertical locations are not well defined, covariance localization is not straightforward. The global group filter (GGF) is an adaptive localization algorithm, which can provide adaptively estimated localization parameters including the localization width and vertical location of observations for each channel and every satellite platform of radiance data, and for different regions and times. This adaptive method is based on sample correlations between ensemble priors of observations and state variables, aiming to minimize sampling errors of estimated sample correlations. The adaptively estimated localization parameters are examined here for typhoon Yutu (2018), using the regional model WRF and a cycling EnKF system. The benefits of differentiating the localization parameters for TC and non-TC regions and varying the localization parameters with time are investigated. Results from the 6-h priors verified relative to the conventional and radiance observations show that the adaptively estimated localization parameters generally produce smaller errors than the default Gaspari and Cohn (GC) localization. The adaptively estimated localization parameters better capture the onset of RI and yield improved intensity and structure forecasts for typhoon Yutu (2018) compared to the default GC localization. The time-varying localization parameters have slightly advantages over the time-constant localization parameters. Further improvements are achieved by differentiating the localization parameters for TC and non-TC regions.",

Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Accurate estimation of forecast\u2010error covariance matrices is an essential step in data assimilation, which becomes a challenging task for high\u2010dimensional data assimilation. The standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) may diverge due to both the limited ensemble size and the model bias. In this article, we propose to replace the sample covariance in the EnKF with a statistically consistent high\u2010dimensional tapering covariance matrix estimator to counter the estimation problem under high dimensions. A high\u2010dimensional EnKF scheme combining covariance localization with the inflation method and an iterative update structure is developed. The proposed assimilation scheme is tested on the Lorenz\u201096 model with spatially correlated observation systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed method could improve the assimilation performance under multiple settings.",

Computational statistics (Zeitschrift), 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: We propose a novel localization strategy for the ensemble Kalman filter procedure based on sparse precision matrices, which we denote precision localization. We assume the latent state vector to come from a Gaussian Markov random field and use the iterative proportional scaling algorithm to estimate the associated sparse precision matrix. Precision localization is compared against a standard covariance localization technique in two simulation studies; one with a Gauss-linear model and one based on the Lorenz 96 model. We evaluate the results by their prediction accuracy and to what degree the generated ensembles give a realistic representation of the exact filtering distributions. In the Gauss-linear example we also compare our results with the Kalman filter solution. Here we see that both precision and covariance localization produce reasonably good results in terms of prediction accuracy, but that precision localization provides the best representation of the correlation structure in the filtering distribution. For the Lorenz model we cannot compare with the Kalman filter solution, but precision localization seems to provide the most accurate predictions and the most realistic uncertainty representation.",

Young-Chan Noh, Eui-Seok Chung, Yonghan Choi, Hyo-Jong Song, Kevin Raeder, Joo-Hong Kim. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Localization is an essential technique to mitigate the sampling error in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). In order to effectively use the localization function within the EnKF, the specific location information of observations being assimilated is required to measure the distance between the model state variables and the observations. Since the satellite-observed radiance represents integrated quantities across the entire vertical profile of an atmospheric column, it is, however, a challenging issue to accurately assign the vertical location, especially for the satellite radiances sensitive to the variable atmospheric constituents (e.g., water vapor). In this study, we propose an efficient method for assigning the vertical location for observations of microwave humidity sounders (MHSs) onboard low-earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites, using discrete spectral characteristics between the 60 GHz oxygen and 183 GHz water vapor absorption bands. As the radiance differences between the channels are solely used as the predictors for estimating the vertical location in a multivariate regression framework, there is no need to conduct radiative transfer simulations that require additional computation costs. The estimated vertical locations are employed for the vertical localization function within the Data Assimilation (DA) Research Testbed (DART) implementation of ensemble filtering. The verification results show that applying vertical localization to observations from MHSs significantly improves the water vapor analysis derived by the DART system, particularly in the lower troposphere.",

Space Weather, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Data assimilation aims to enhance the system state estimate by merging sparse and diverse measurements with physical models, while considering their individual uncertainties. As a highly promising data assimilation technique, Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is well\u2010suited for addressing nonlinear, complex, and high\u2010dimensional problems. As a result, EnKF has emerged as an increasingly important tool for the reanalysis and prediction of highly dynamic variations of energetic electrons in Earth's radiation belt. However, EnKF often encounters the challenge of spurious correlations between observations and state variables due to insufficient ensemble size. In this study, we introduce a covariance localization method to address this issue in the radiation belt data assimilation. We validate the covariance localization method through a twin experiment, which demonstrates its effectiveness in truncating spurious correlations between variables along three\u2010dimensional grids (radial distance, pitch angle, and energy). Furthermore, EnKF with covariance localization enables usage of fewer ensemble members to achieve reanalysis results that closely approximate the \u201ctruth,\u201d thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Finally, using the localized EnKF with 15 ensemble members, in combination with measurements from Van Allen Probes and GOES satellites, we reconstruct the spatial and temporal evolution of radiation belt electrons in March 2013 as an illustrative purpose. Our study demonstrates that the application of covariance localization method can effectively improve the performance of ensemble data assimilation of radiation belt electrons, particularly for finite ensemble sizes. This sheds important light on future efforts of nowcast and forecast of Earth's radiation belt electron dynamical variability."
