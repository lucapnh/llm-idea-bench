Our active learning scheme consists of an unsupervised machine learning (ML) scheme coupled with a Bayesian optimization technique that evaluates the GAP model.

The melt and amorphous X-ray structural factors generated from our simulation are in good agreement with experiment. In addition, the calculated diffusion constants are in good agreement with previous ab initio studies.",

Chemical Science, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 36\nAbstract: Predictive molecular simulations require fast, accurate and reactive interatomic potentials. Machine learning offers a promising approach to construct such potentials by fitting energies and forces to high-level quantum-mechanical data, but doing so typically requires considerable human intervention and data volume. Here we show that, by leveraging hierarchical and active learning, accurate Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) models can be developed for diverse chemical systems in an autonomous manner, requiring only hundreds to a few thousand energy and gradient evaluations on a reference potential-energy surface. The approach uses separate intra- and inter-molecular fits and employs a prospective error metric to assess the accuracy of the potentials. We demonstrate applications to a range of molecular systems with relevance to computational organic chemistry: ranging from bulk solvents, a solvated metal ion and a metallocage onwards to chemical reactivity, including a bifurcating Diels\u2013Alder reaction in the gas phase and non-equilibrium dynamics (a model SN2 reaction) in explicit solvent. The method provides a route to routinely generating machine-learned force fields for reactive molecular systems.",

Benmore, Nicholas E. Jackson. Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 36\nAbstract: The in silico modeling of molten salts is critical for emerging \"carbon-free\" energy applications but is inhibited by the cost of quantum mechanically treating the high polarizabilities of molten salts. Here, we integrate configurational sampling using classical force fields with active learning to automate and accelerate the generation of Gaussian approximation potentials (GAP) for molten salts. This methodology reduces the number of expensive ab initio evaluations required for training set generation to O(100), enabling the facile parametrization of a molten LiCl GAP model that exhibits a 19\u202f000-fold speedup relative to AIMD. The developed molten LiCl GAP model is applied to sample extended spatiotemporal scales, permitting new physical insights into molten LiCl's coordination structure as well as experimentally validated predictions of structures, densities, self-diffusion constants, and ionic conductivities. The developed methodology significantly lowers the barrier to the in silico understanding and design of molten salts across the periodic table.",

Maresca. npj Computational Materials, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 26\nAbstract: The prediction of atomistic fracture mechanisms in body-centred cubic (bcc) iron is essential for understanding its semi-brittle nature. Existing atomistic simulations of the crack-tip under mode-I loading based on empirical interatomic potentials yield contradicting predictions and artificial mechanisms. To enable fracture prediction with quantum accuracy, we develop a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) using an active learning strategy by extending a density functional theory (DFT) database of ferromagnetic bcc iron. We apply the active learning algorithm and obtain a Fe GAP model with a converged model uncertainty over a broad range of stress intensity factors (SIFs) and for four crack systems. The learning efficiency of the approach is analysed, and the predicted critical SIFs are compared with Griffith and Rice theories. The simulations reveal that cleavage along the original crack plane is the atomistic fracture mechanism for {100} and {110} crack planes at T\u2009=\u20090\u2009K, thus settling a long-standing issue. Our work also highlights the need for a multiscale approach to predicting fracture and intrinsic ductility, whereby finite temperature, finite loading rate effects and pre-existing defects (e.g., nanovoids, dislocations) should be taken explicitly into account.",

Journal of Chemical Physics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 16\nAbstract: Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is an extensively used material in the automotive, aerospace, and semiconductor industries. However, its widespread use is in contrast to the scarce availability of reliable interatomic potentials that can be employed to study various aspects of this material on an atomistic scale, particularly its amorphous phase. In this work, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential, using an efficient active learning technique, combined with the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) method. Our strategy is based on using an inexpensive empirical potential to generate an initial dataset of atomic configurations, for which energies and forces were recalculated with density functional theory (DFT); thereafter, a GAP was trained on these data and an iterative re-training algorithm was used to improve it by learning on-the-fly. When compared to DFT, our potential yielded a mean absolute error of 8 meV/atom in energy calculations for a variety of liquid and amorphous structures and a speed-up of molecular dynamics simulations by 3-4 orders of magnitude, while achieving a first-rate agreement with experimental results. Our potential is publicly available in an open-access repository.",

Hoyt, M. Williamson, Ian T Foster, C. Benmore, Nicholas E. Jackson, G. Sivaraman. Journal of Chemical Physics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 12\nAbstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a powerful tool for bypassing the spatiotemporal limitations of ab\u00a0initio simulations, but major challenges remain in their efficient parameterization. We present AL4GAP, an ensemble active learning software workflow for generating multicomposition Gaussian approximation potentials (GAP) for arbitrary molten salt mixtures. The workflow capabilities include: (1) setting up user-defined combinatorial chemical spaces of charge neutral mixtures of arbitrary molten mixtures spanning 11 cations (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and two heavy species, Nd, and Th) and 4 anions (F, Cl, Br, and I), (2) configurational sampling using low-cost empirical parameterizations, (3) active learning for down-selecting configurational samples for single point density functional theory calculations at the level of Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional, and (4) Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning of two-body and many-body GAP models. We apply the AL4GAP workflow to showcase high throughput generation of five independent GAP models for multicomposition binary-mixture melts, each of increasing complexity with respect to charge valency and electronic structure, namely: LiCl-KCl, NaCl-CaCl2, KCl-NdCl3, CaCl2-NdCl3, and KCl-ThCl4. Our results indicate that GAP models can accurately predict structure for diverse molten salt mixture with density functional theory (DFT)-SCAN accuracy, capturing the intermediate range ordering characteristic of the multivalent cationic melts.",

Firas Shuaib, Guido Ori, Philippe Thomas, Olivier Masson, A. Bouzid. Journal of The American Ceramic Society, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: We present a hybrid similarity kernel that exemplifies the integration of short\u2010 and long\u2010range descriptors via the use of an average kernel approach. This technique allows for a direct measure of the similarity between amorphous configurations, and when combined with an active learning (AL) spectral clustering approach, it leads to a classification of the amorphous configurations into uncorrelated clusters. Subsequently, a minimum size database is built by considering a small fraction of configurations belonging to each cluster and a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), within the Gaussian approximation scheme, is fitted by relying on a Bayesian optimization of the potential hyperparameters. This step is embedded within an AL loop that allows to sequentially increase the size of the learning database whenever the MLIP fails to meet a predefined energy convergence threshold. As such, MLIP are fitted in an almost fully automatized fashion. This approach is tested on two diverse amorphous systems that were previously generated using first\u2010principles molecular dynamics. Accurate potentials with less than 2 meV/atom root mean square energy error compared to the reference data are obtained. This accuracy is achieved with only 175 configurations sampling the studied systems at various temperatures. The robustness of these potentials is then confirmed by producing models with several thousands of atoms featuring a good agreement with reference ab initio and experimental\u00a0data.",

Motivated by this challenge, we developed composition-transferable Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAP) for molten LiCl-KCl. A DFT-SCAN accurate GAP is active learned from only ~1100 training configurations drawn from 10 unique mixture compositions enriched with metadynamics.

IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Elucidating electrostatic surface potentials contributes to a deeper understanding of the nature of matter and its physicochemical properties, which is the basis for a wide field of applications. Scanning quantum dot microscopy, a recently developed technique allows to measure such potentials with atomic resolution. For an efficient deployment in scientific practice, however, it is essential to speed up the scanning process. To this end we employ a two-degree-of-freedom control paradigm, in which a Gaussian process is used as the feed-forward part. We present a tailored online learning scheme of the Gaussian process, adapted to scanning quantum dot microscopy, that includes hyperparameter optimization during operation to enable fast and precise scanning of arbitrary surface structures. For the potential application in practice, the accompanying computational cost is reduced evaluating different sparse approximation approaches. The fully independent training conditional approximation, used on a reduced set of active training data, is found to be the most promising approach."
