Chemical Reviews, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 759\nAbstract: We provide an introduction to Gaussian process regression (GPR) machine-learning methods in computational materials science and chemistry. The focus of the present review is on the regression of atomistic properties: in particular, on the construction of interatomic potentials, or force fields, in the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) framework; beyond this, we also discuss the fitting of arbitrary scalar, vectorial, and tensorial quantities. Methodological aspects of reference data generation, representation, and regression, as well as the question of how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically discussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions in chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in the field. A vision is outlined for the development of the methodology in the years to come.",

Deringer, G\u00e1bor Cs\u00e1nyi. , 2016.\nNumber of citations: 443\nAbstract: We introduce a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for atomistic simulations of liquid and amorphous elemental carbon. Based on a machine learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT) potential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with a state-of-the-art empirical potential. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of \u201cdiamondlike\u201d tetrahedral amorphous carbon ($\\textit{ta}$-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material\u2019s surface energy and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions (\u201cgraphitization\u201d). The presented interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.",

Stan, G\u00e1bor Cs\u00e1nyi, C. Benmore, \u00c1. V\u00e1zquez-Mayagoitia. npj Computational Materials, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 164\nAbstract: We propose an active learning scheme for automatically sampling a minimum number of uncorrelated configurations for fitting the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP). Our active learning scheme consists of an unsupervised machine learning (ML) scheme coupled with a Bayesian optimization technique that evaluates the GAP model. We apply this scheme to a Hafnium dioxide (HfO 2 ) dataset generated from a \u201cmelt-quench\u201d ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) protocol. Our results show that the active learning scheme, with no prior knowledge of the dataset, is able to extract a configuration that reaches the required energy fit tolerance. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed using this active learned GAP model on 6144 atom systems of amorphous and liquid state elucidate the structural properties of HfO 2 with near ab initio precision and quench rates (i.e., 1.0\u2009K/ps) not accessible via AIMD. The melt and amorphous X-ray structural factors generated from our simulation are in good agreement with experiment. In addition, the calculated diffusion constants are in good agreement with previous ab initio studies.",

Journal of Chemical Physics, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 82\nAbstract: We demonstrate how machine-learning based interatomic potentials can be used to model guest atoms in host structures. Specifically, we generate Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) models for the interaction of lithium atoms with graphene, graphite, and disordered carbon nanostructures, based on reference density functional theory data. Rather than treating the full Li-C system, we demonstrate how the energy and force differences arising from Li intercalation can be modeled and then added to a (prexisting and unmodified) GAP model of pure elemental carbon. Furthermore, we show the benefit of using an explicit pair potential fit to capture \"effective\" Li-Li interactions and to improve the performance of the GAP model. This provides proof-of-concept for modeling guest atoms in host frameworks with machine-learning based potentials and in the longer run is promising for carrying out detailed atomistic studies of battery materials.",

PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 46\nAbstract: We report that single interatomic potential, developed using Gaussian regression of density functional theory calculation data, has high accuracy and flexibility to describe phonon transport with ab initio accuracy in two different atomistic configurations: perfect crystalline Si and crystalline Si with vacancies. The high accuracy of second- and third-order force constants from the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) are demonstrated with phonon dispersion, Gruneisen parameter, three-phonon scattering rate, phonon-vacancy scattering rate, and thermal conductivity, all of which are very close to the results from density functional theory calculation. We also show that the widely used empirical potentials (Stillinger-Weber and Tersoff) produce much larger errors compared to the GAP. The computational cost of GAP is higher than the two empirical potentials, but five orders of magnitude lower than the density functional theory calculation. Our work shows that GAP can provide a new opportunity for studying phonon transport in partially disordered crystalline phases with the high predictive power of ab initio calculation but at a feasible computational cost.",

Hua. npj Computational Materials, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 42\nAbstract: Ga_2O_3 is a wide-band gap semiconductor of emergent importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. However, vital information of the properties of complex coexisting Ga_2O_3 polymorphs and low-symmetry disordered structures is missing. We develop two types of machine-learning Gaussian approximation potentials (ML-GAPs) for Ga_2O_3 with high accuracy for \u03b2 / \u03ba / \u03b1 / \u03b4 / \u03b3 polymorphs and generality for disordered stoichiometric structures. We release two versions of interatomic potentials in parallel, namely soapGAP and tabGAP, for high accuracy and exceeding speedup, respectively. Both potentials can reproduce the structural properties of all the five polymorphs in an exceptional agreement with ab initio results, meanwhile boost the computational efficiency with 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910^2 and 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910^5 computing speed increases compared to density functional theory, respectively. Moreover, the Ga_2O_3 liquid-solid phase transition proceeds in three different stages. This experimentally unrevealed complex dynamics can be understood in terms of distinctly different mobilities of O and Ga sublattices in the interfacial layer.",

Nanomaterials, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 12\nAbstract: The lithium thiophosphate (LPS) material class provides promising candidates for solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) in lithium ion batteries due to high lithium ion conductivities, non-critical elements, and low material cost. LPS materials are characterized by complex thiophosphate microchemistry and structural disorder influencing the material performance. To overcome the length and time scale restrictions of ab initio calculations to industrially applicable LPS materials, we develop a near-universal machine-learning interatomic potential for the LPS material class. The trained Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) can likewise describe crystal and glassy materials and different P-S connectivities PmSn. We apply the GAP surrogate model to probe lithium ion conductivity and the influence of thiophosphate subunits on the latter. The materials studied are crystals (modifications of Li3PS4 and Li7P3S11), and glasses of the xLi2S\u2013(100 \u2013 x)P2S5 type (x = 67, 70 and 75). The obtained material properties are well aligned with experimental findings and we underscore the role of anion dynamics on lithium ion conductivity in glassy LPS. The GAP surrogate approach allows for a variety of extensions and transferability to other SSEs.",

Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: \n Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have massively changed the field of atomistic modeling. They enable the accuracy of density functional theory in large-scale simulations while being nearly as fast as classical interatomic potentials. Over the last few years, a wide range of different types of MLIPs have been developed, but it is often difficult to judge which approach is the best for a given problem setting. For the case of structurally and chemically complex solids, namely Al-Cu-Zr and Si-O, we benchmark a range of machine learning interatomic potential approaches, in particular, the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP), moment tensor potentials (MTP), the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) in its linear and nonlinear version, neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP), Allegro, and MACE. We find that nonlinear ACE and the equivariant, message-passing graph neural networks NequIP and MACE form the Pareto front in the accuracy vs. computational cost trade-off. In case of the Al-Cu-Zr system we find that MACE and Allegro offer the highest accuracy, while NequIP outperforms them for Si-O. Furthermore, GPUs can massively accelerate the MLIPs, bringing them on par with and even ahead of non-accelerated classical interatomic potentials (IPs) with regards to accessible timescales. Finally, we explore the extrapolation behavior of the corresponding potentials, probe the smoothness of the potential energy surfaces, and finally estimate the user friendliness of the corresponding fitting codes and molecular dynamics interfaces.",

PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Machine learning (ML) has become widely used in the development of interatomic potentials for molecular dynamics simulations. However, most ML potentials are still much slower than classical interatomic potentials and are usually trained with near equilibrium simulations in mind. In this work, we develop ML potentials for Cu, Al and Ni using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) method. Specifically, we create the low-dimensional tabulated versions (tabGAP) of the potentials, which allow for two orders of magnitude higher computational efficiency than the GAPs, enabling simulations of large multi-million atomic systems. The ML potentials are trained using diverse curated databases of structures and include fixed external repulsive potentials for short-range interactions. The potentials are extensively validated and used to simulate a wide range of fundamental materials properties, such as stacking faults and threshold displacement energies. Furthermore, we use the potentials to simulate single-crystal uniaxial compressive loading in different crystal orientations with both pristine simulation cells and cells containing pre-existing defects.",
        "10": "Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Bulk Hexagonal Boron Nitride. Jialin Tang, Qi Wang, Jiongzhi Zheng, Lin Cheng, Ruiqiang Guo. , 2022.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The highly anisotropic thermal conductivity in layered materials is crucial for a broad range of applications such as thermal management of electronic devices, thermal insulation, and thermoelectrics. Understanding of anisotropic thermal transport in layered materials largely depends on atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) or empirical potentials, which however suffer either low computational efficiency or accuracy. Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are emerging as a powerful tool to bridge the gap. Despite the recent progress in developing MLIPs, little attention has been paid to constructing a potential that can accurately predict the thermal properties of layered materials, which is more challenging compared with the case of isotropic materials because of the highly anisotropic bonding and weak van der Waals interactions in layered materials. Here, we introduce a MLIP within the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework for bulk hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with a typical layered structure. The GAP can well predict the highly anisotropic phonon transport properties and thermal conductivity of bulk h-BN with DFT-level accuracy at orders of magnitude reduced cost. Our work demonstrates the ability of GAP to reproduce the subtle features of anisotropic potential energy surfaces of bulk h-BN and potentially other layered materials. Atomistic simulations based on MLIPs are expected to be able to greatly promote the understanding of phonon transport and the prediction of thermophysical properties in layered materials."
