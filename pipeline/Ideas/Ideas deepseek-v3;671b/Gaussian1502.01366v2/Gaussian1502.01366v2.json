        "Short Hypothesis": "By leveraging the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) framework, we can accurately model anisotropic phonon transport properties in layered materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bridging the gap between computational efficiency and DFT-level accuracy.",
        "Related Work": "Recent studies have demonstrated GAP's ability to predict thermal conductivity with high accuracy in isotropic materials.

        "Abstract": "The highly anisotropic thermal properties of layered materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) present a significant computational challenge for accurate modeling. This proposal aims to develop and validate Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAP) tailored specifically for h-BN, focusing on capturing its phonon transport behavior with DFT-level accuracy but at significantly reduced computational cost. By leveraging active learning techniques and diverse training datasets, we will construct GAP models capable of predicting anisotropic thermal conductivity and other critical properties in layered materials. Our approach will address the limitations of traditional empirical potentials and pave the way for scalable simulations of complex systems.",

However, accurate prediction of these properties requires computationally expensive first-principles methods or empirical potentials with limited accuracy. Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAP), trained on density functional theory data, offer a promising compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we propose to develop GAP models for emerging 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides and heterostructures, and use them to predict phonon dispersion curves, lattice thermal conductivity, and other key properties. We will validate our predictions against experimental data and first-principles calculations, demonstrating the potential of GAP for high-throughput screening of novel 2D materials.",

Recent findings reveal that the learned neural score is dominated by its linear (Gaussian) approximation for moderate to high noise scales, enabling analytical predictions of sampling trajectories. We propose a novel hybrid sampling method, termed Analytical Teleportation, which leverages Gaussian approximations to skip the initial 15-30% of sampling steps while maintaining sample quality. Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that this approach achieves near state-of-the-art FID scores (1.93) and reduces computational overhead by up to 40%. This work provides a practical framework for accelerating diffusion models without compromising performance, offering insights into the interplay between learned scores and their Gaussian approximations.",
