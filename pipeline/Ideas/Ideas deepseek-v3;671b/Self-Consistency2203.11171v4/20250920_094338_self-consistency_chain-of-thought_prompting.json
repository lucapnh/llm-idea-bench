        "1": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models. Xuezhi Wang, Jason Wei, D. Schuurmans, Quoc Le, Ed H. Chi, Denny Zhou. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 4262\nAbstract: Chain-of-thought prompting combined with pre-trained large language models has achieved encouraging results on complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9%).",

Xinyun Chen, Renat Aksitov, Uri Alon, Jie Ren, Kefan Xiao, Pengcheng Yin, Sushant Prakash, Charles Sutton, Xuezhi Wang, Denny Zhou. arXiv.org, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 95\nAbstract: Self-consistency with chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) has demonstrated remarkable performance gains on various challenging tasks, by utilizing multiple reasoning paths sampled from large language models (LLMs). However, self-consistency relies on the answer extraction process to aggregate multiple solutions, which is not applicable to free-form answers. In this work, we propose Universal Self-Consistency (USC), which leverages LLMs themselves to select the most consistent answer among multiple candidates. We evaluate USC on a variety of benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, long-context summarization, and open-ended question answering. On open-ended generation tasks where the original self-consistency method is not applicable, USC effectively utilizes multiple samples and improves the performance. For mathematical reasoning, USC matches the standard self-consistency performance without requiring the answer formats to be similar. Finally, without access to execution results, USC also matches the execution-based voting performance on code generation.",
        "3": "Better Patching Using LLM Prompting, via Self-Consistency. Toufique Ahmed, Prem Devanbu. International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 36\nAbstract: Large Language models (LLMs) can be induced to solve non-trivial problems with \u201cfew-shot\u201d prompts including illustrative problem-solution examples. Now if the few-shots also include \u201cchain of thought\u201d ($\\mathcal{C}oT$) explanations, which are of the form problem-explanation-solution, LLMs will generate a \u201cexplained\u201d solution, and perform even better. Recently an exciting, substantially better technique, self-consistency [1] ($\\mathcal{S}-C$) has emerged, based on the intuition that there are many plausible explanations for the right solution; when the LLM is sampled repeatedly to generate a pool of explanation-solution pairs, for a given problem, the most frequently occurring solutions in the pool (ignoring the explanations) tend to be even more likely to be correct! Unfortunately, the use of this highly-performant $\\mathcal{S}-C$ (or even $\\mathcal{C}oT$) approach in software engineering settings is hampered by the lack of explanations; most software datasets lack explanations. In this paper, we describe an application of the $\\mathcal{S}-C$ approach to program repair, using the commit log on the fix as the explanation, only in the illustrative few-shots. We achieve state-of-the art results, beating previous approaches to prompting-based program repair, on the MODIT dataset; we also find evidence suggesting that the correct commit messages are helping the LLM learn to produce better patches.",

Knowledge Science, Engineering and Management, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 27\nAbstract: We investigate how to enhance answer precision in frequently asked questions posed by distributed users using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Our study focuses on a typical situations where users ask similar queries that involve identical mathematical reasoning steps and problem-solving procedures. Due to the unsatisfactory accuracy of LLMs' zero-shot prompting with standalone questions, we propose to improve the distributed synonymous questions using Self-Consistency (SC) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, we first retrieve synonymous questions from a crowd-sourced database and create a federated question pool. We call these federated synonymous questions with the same or different parameters SP-questions or DP-questions, respectively. We refer to our methods as Fed-SP-SC and Fed-DP-CoT, which can generate significantly more accurate answers for all user queries without requiring sophisticated model-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed methods can significantly enhance question accuracy by fully exploring the synonymous nature of the questions and the consistency of the answers.",

Neural Information Processing Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 24\nAbstract: This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): chain-of-thought prompting with noisy rationales, which include irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning thoughts within examples used for in-context learning. We construct NoRa dataset that is tailored to evaluate the robustness of reasoning in the presence of noisy rationales. Our findings on NoRa dataset reveal a prevalent vulnerability to such noise among current LLMs, with existing robust methods like self-correction and self-consistency showing limited efficacy. Notably, compared to prompting with clean rationales, base LLM drops by 1.4%-19.8% in accuracy with irrelevant thoughts and more drastically by 2.2%-40.4% with inaccurate thoughts. Addressing this challenge necessitates external supervision that should be accessible in practice. Here, we propose the method of contrastive denoising with noisy chain-of-thought (CD-CoT). It enhances LLMs' denoising-reasoning capabilities by contrasting noisy rationales with only one clean rationale, which can be the minimal requirement for denoising-purpose prompting. This method follows a principle of exploration and exploitation: (1) rephrasing and selecting rationales in the input space to achieve explicit denoising and (2) exploring diverse reasoning paths and voting on answers in the output space. Empirically, CD-CoT demonstrates an average improvement of 17.8% in accuracy over the base model and shows significantly stronger denoising capabilities than baseline methods.

        "7": "Chain of Evidences and Evidence to Generate: Prompting for Context Grounded and Retrieval Augmented Reasoning. Md. Rizwan Parvez. Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Knowledge-Augmented Methods for Natural Language Processing, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: While chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting has revolutionized how LLMs perform reasoning tasks, its current methods and variations (e.g, Self-consistency, ReACT, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Cumulative Reasoning (CR) etc.,) suffer from limitations like limited context grounding, hallucination/inconsistent output generation, and iterative sluggishness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel mono/dual-step zero-shot prompting framework built upon two unique strategies Chain of Evidences (CoE)} and Evidence to Generate (E2G). Instead of unverified reasoning claims, our innovative approaches leverage the power of\"evidence for decision making\"by first focusing exclusively on the thought sequences explicitly mentioned in the context which then serve as extracted evidence, guiding the LLM's output generation process with greater precision and efficiency. This simple yet potent approach unlocks the full potential of chain-of-thoughts prompting, facilitating faster, more reliable, and contextually aware reasoning in LLMs. Our framework consistently achieves remarkable results across various knowledge-intensive reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing baseline approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, (i) on the LogiQA benchmark using GPT-4, CoE achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 53.8%, surpassing CoT by 18%, ToT by 11%, and CR by 9%; (ii) CoE with PaLM-2 outperforms the variable-shot performance of Gemini Ultra by 0.9 F1 points, achieving an F1 score of 83.3 on DROP. We release our prompts and outputs on these benchmarks as a new instruction tuning dataset for future research at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kagnlp/Chain-of-Evidences/.",

Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine in Europe, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have encouraged their adoption in the healthcare domain where vital clinical information is often contained in unstructured notes. Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms. Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in determining cancer stage, thereby demonstrating the potential to use these models in clinical or other domains where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.",
