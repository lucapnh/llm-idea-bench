International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 3639\nAbstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

International Conference on Machine Learning, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 248\nAbstract: While language models (LMs) have shown potential across a range of decision-making tasks, their reliance on simple acting processes limits their broad deployment as autonomous agents. In this paper, we introduce Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) -- the first general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LMs in reasoning, acting, and planning. By leveraging the in-context learning ability of LMs, we integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search into LATS to enable LMs as agents, along with LM-powered value functions and self-reflections for proficient exploration and enhanced decision-making. A key feature of our approach is the incorporation of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that surpasses the constraints of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, including programming, interactive question-answering (QA), web navigation, and math, validates the effectiveness and generality of LATS in decision-making while maintaining competitive or improved reasoning performance. Notably, LATS achieves state-of-the-art pass@1 accuracy (92.7%) for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and demonstrates gradient-free performance (average score of 75.9) comparable to gradient-based fine-tuning for web navigation on WebShop with GPT-3.5.

Zehui Chen, Kuikun Liu, Qiuchen Wang, Wenwei Zhang, Jiangning Liu, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen, Feng Zhao. Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 40\nAbstract: Open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various NLP tasks, however, they are still far inferior to API-based models when acting as agents. How to integrate agent ability into general LLMs becomes a crucial and urgent problem. This paper first delivers three key observations: (1) the current agent training corpus is entangled with both formats following and agent reasoning, which significantly shifts from the distribution of its pre-training data; (2) LLMs exhibit different learning speeds on the capabilities required by agent tasks; and (3) current approaches have side-effects when improving agent abilities by introducing hallucinations. Based on the above findings, we propose Agent-FLAN to effectively Fine-tune LANguage models for Agents. Through careful decomposition and redesign of the training corpus, Agent-FLAN enables Llama2-7B to outperform prior best works by 3.5\\% across various agent evaluation datasets. With comprehensively constructed negative samples, Agent-FLAN greatly alleviates the hallucination issues based on our established evaluation benchmark. Besides, it consistently improves the agent capability of LLMs when scaling model sizes while slightly enhancing the general capability of LLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/InternLM/Agent-FLAN.",

Na Liu, Liangyu Chen, Xiaoyu Tian, Wei Zou, Kaijiang Chen, Ming Cui. arXiv.org, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 38\nAbstract: This paper introduces RAISE (Reasoning and Acting through Scratchpad and Examples), an advanced architecture enhancing the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into conversational agents. RAISE, an enhancement of the ReAct framework, incorporates a dual-component memory system, mirroring human short-term and long-term memory, to maintain context and continuity in conversations. It entails a comprehensive agent construction scenario, including phases like Conversation Selection, Scene Extraction, CoT Completion, and Scene Augmentation, leading to the LLMs Training phase. This approach appears to enhance agent controllability and adaptability in complex, multi-turn dialogues. Our preliminary evaluations in a real estate sales context suggest that RAISE has some advantages over traditional agents, indicating its potential for broader applications. This work contributes to the AI field by providing a robust framework for developing more context-aware and versatile conversational agents.",

IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 14\nAbstract: To operate at a building scale, service robots must perform long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks by navigating to different rooms, accessing multiple floors, and interacting with a wide and unseen range of everyday objects. We refer to these tasks as Building-wide Mobile Manipulation. To tackle these inherently long-horizon tasks, we introduce BUMBLE, a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework integrating open-world RGB-D perception, a wide spectrum of gross-to-fine motor skills, and dual-layered memory. Our extensive evaluation (90+ hours) indicates that BUMBLE outperforms competitive baselines in long-horizon building-wide tasks that require sequencing up to 12 skills, spanning 15 minutes per trial. BUMBLE achieves 47.1% success rate averaged over 70 trials in different buildings, tasks, and scene layouts from various starting locations. Our user study shows 22% higher task satisfaction using our framework compared to state-of-the-art VLM-based mobile manipulation methods. Finally, we show the potential of using increasingly capable foundation models to improve the system performance further. For more information, see https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/BUMBLE/",

Xiaoyu Chen, Shenao Zhang, Pushi Zhang, Li Zhao, Jianyu Chen. , 2023.\nNumber of citations: 10\nAbstract: With strong capabilities of reasoning and a broad understanding of the world, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential in building versatile embodied decision-making agents capable of executing a wide array of tasks. Nevertheless, when deployed in unfamiliar environments, we show that LLM agents encounter challenges in efficiently gathering essential information, leading to suboptimal performance. Conversely, human individuals often seek additional information from their peers prior to taking action, harnessing external knowledge to avoid unnecessary trial and error. Drawing inspiration from this behavior, we propose \\textit{Asking Before Acting} (ABA), a method that empowers the agent to proactively inquire with external sources for pertinent information using natural language during their interactions within the environment. In this way, the agent is able to enhance its efficiency and performance by circumventing potentially laborious steps and combating the difficulties associated with exploration in unfamiliar environments and vagueness of the instructions. We conduct extensive experiments involving a spectrum of environments including text-based household everyday tasks, robot arm manipulation tasks, and real world open domain image based embodied tasks. The experiments involve various models from Vicuna to GPT-4. The results demonstrate that, even with modest prompts modifications, ABA exhibits substantial advantages on both performance and efficiency over baseline LLM agents. Further finetuning ABA with reformulated metadata (ABA-FT) faciliates learning the rationale for asking and allows for additional enhancements especially in tasks that baselines struggle to solve.",

IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various generative tasks. However, their performance is often hampered by limitations in accessing and leveraging long-term memory, leading to specific vulnerabilities and biases, especially during long interactions. This paper introduces ChatLogic, an innovative framework specifically targeted at LLM reasoning tasks that can enhance the performance of LLMs in multi-step deductive reasoning tasks by integrating logic programming. In Chat-Logic, the language model plays a central role, acting as a controller and participating in every system operation stage. We propose a novel method of converting logic problems into symbolic integration with an inference engine. This approach leverages large language models\u2019 situational understanding and imitation skills and uses symbolic memory to enhance multi-step deductive reasoning capabilities. Our results show that the ChatLogic framework significantly improves the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Strong-AI-Lab/ChatLogic.",

Yen-Che Hsiao, Abhishek Dutta. arXiv.org, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: We propose a novel in-context learning algorithm for building autonomous decision-making language agents. The language agent continuously attempts to solve the same task by self-correcting each time the task fails. Our selected language agent demonstrates the ability to solve tasks in a text-based game environment. Our results show that the gemma-2-9b-it language model, using our proposed method, can successfully complete two of six tasks that failed in the first attempt. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of a single language model through self-correction, paving the way for more advanced autonomous agents.

        "9": "Furthest Reasoning with Plan Assessment: Stable Reasoning Path with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models. Yin Zhu, Zhiling Luo, Gong Cheng. arXiv.org, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), acting as a powerful reasoner and generator, exhibit extraordinary performance across various natural language tasks, such as question answering (QA). Among these tasks, Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) stands as a widely discussed category, necessitating seamless integration between LLMs and the retrieval of external knowledge. Existing methods employ LLM to generate reasoning paths and plans, and utilize IR to iteratively retrieve related knowledge, but these approaches have inherent flaws. On one hand, Information Retriever (IR) is hindered by the low quality of generated queries by LLM. On the other hand, LLM is easily misguided by the irrelevant knowledge by IR. These inaccuracies, accumulated by the iterative interaction between IR and LLM, lead to a disaster in effectiveness at the end. To overcome above barriers, in this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for MHQA called Furthest-Reasoning-with-Plan-Assessment (FuRePA), including an improved framework (Furthest Reasoning) and an attached module (Plan Assessor). 1) Furthest reasoning operates by masking previous reasoning path and generated queries for LLM, encouraging LLM generating chain of thought from scratch in each iteration. This approach enables LLM to break the shackle built by previous misleading thoughts and queries (if any). 2) The Plan Assessor is a trained evaluator that selects an appropriate plan from a group of candidate plans proposed by LLM. Our methods are evaluated on three highly recognized public multi-hop question answering datasets and outperform state-of-the-art on most metrics (achieving a 10%-12% in answer accuracy).",

IEEE Access, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Victims and witnesses of cybercrime often hesitate to report incidents due to concerns over privacy, complexity, and fear of retaliation. Traditional reporting mechanisms require manual data entry, creating accessibility barriers and delaying response times. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ReACT_OCRS, an AI-driven voice-based cybercrime reporting system that allows victims and witnesses to anonymously submit complaints through audio recordings. Leveraging speech recognition transformers, a recent language model, and encryption, the system processes real-time multilingual voice inputs, extracts meaningful content, and classifies reports with high precision using a hybrid voting mechanism. Experimental evaluations on synthetically generated and human-validated datasets confirm the system\u2019s ability to accurately transcribe, classify, and securely process audio complaints while preserving user anonymity. This work improves cybercrime reporting by making it more accessible, efficient, and secure, fostering greater participation from victims and witnesses."
