        "Title": "Consistency Models for High-Fidelity One-Step Music Generation",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Can consistency models, which map noisy samples directly to clean data in one step, be extended to music generation while maintaining high fidelity and enabling zero-shot editing tasks like tempo adjustment and style transfer?",
        "Related Work": "Existing work on consistency models (e.g., Yang et al. 2023) has shown success in image and video generation by reducing sampling steps without sacrificing quality. FlashAudio (Liu et al. 2024) explored rectified flows for text-to-audio but struggled with one-step performance due to curved trajectories. This proposal extends the consistency model framework to music, leveraging its efficiency and zero-shot capabilities.",
        "Abstract": "Consistency models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation by enabling high-quality synthesis in a single step. However, their application to music generation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose extending consistency models to generate high-fidelity music from text or latent representations while maintaining the ability for zero-shot editing tasks such as tempo adjustment, style transfer, and instrument substitution. By leveraging stochastic interpolants and flow map matching principles, our model learns a direct mapping between noisy samples and clean music data in one step. We evaluate the proposed framework on benchmark datasets for music generation, demonstrating its superior efficiency and fidelity compared to traditional diffusion-based models."

        "Short Hypothesis": "Introducing a lightweight consistency enforcement mechanism into transformer-based models can significantly improve coherence and performance in multi-modal tasks like image-text alignment or summarization.",
        "Related Work": "Existing works such as Swin Transformer-based GANs (Yan et al., 2022) focus on modality-specific tasks but do not explicitly address cross-modal consistency. Multi-modal frameworks like SpecTra (Nitin & Ray, 2024) generate specifications for code translation but lack a generalized approach to enforce coherence across modalities.",
        "Abstract": "Multi-modal models often struggle with maintaining coherence across different modalities, such as text and images, leading to inconsistencies that degrade performance in tasks like summarization or alignment. This proposal introduces a novel transformer-based architecture enhanced with a lightweight consistency enforcement mechanism. The model explicitly learns cross-modal relationships by incorporating attention layers that align semantic representations of different modalities. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets for image-text alignment and multi-modal summarization, demonstrating improved coherence and task performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results highlight the importance of explicit consistency enforcement in advancing multi-modal applications.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Using consistency models as policy representations in reinforcement learning (RL) can improve both computational efficiency and performance across offline, offline-to-online, and online RL settings.",
        "Related Work": "Previous work has explored the use of generative models like diffusion models for RL policies. However, these methods often suffer from slow inference speeds due to iterative sampling processes. Consistency models have been proposed as an alternative that maintains high expressiveness while significantly reducing computational overhead (Ding & Jin, 2023). This proposal builds on their findings but extends the application of consistency models to a broader range of RL settings and investigates novel training strategies to further enhance performance.",
        "Abstract": "This paper explores the use of consistency models as policy representations in reinforcement learning (RL), aiming to address the computational inefficiencies of existing generative model-based approaches. While diffusion models have shown promise in modeling multi-modal policies, their iterative sampling process can be prohibitively slow for RL applications. Consistency models offer a compelling alternative by enabling efficient one-step or few-step inference while maintaining high expressiveness. We propose an actor-critic style algorithm that leverages consistency models across three key RL settings: offline, offline-to-online, and online learning. Our approach builds on recent advances in consistency model training (e.g., Stable Consistency Tuning) to further improve policy quality and stability. Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate significant speedups over diffusion-based policies while achieving competitive or superior performance.",

Our proposal builds upon these advances by introducing a novel temporal-aware mechanism into diffusion models for stylization.",
        "Abstract": "Zero-shot video stylization is challenging due to the need for maintaining temporal coherence and high-quality visual output without task-specific training. We propose a new approach that integrates temporal awareness directly into text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to perform zero-shot video stylization efficiently. Our method employs cross-frame attention mechanisms to ensure consistency across frames while leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for style transfer. By doing so, we avoid the need for extensive computational resources or specific datasets.
