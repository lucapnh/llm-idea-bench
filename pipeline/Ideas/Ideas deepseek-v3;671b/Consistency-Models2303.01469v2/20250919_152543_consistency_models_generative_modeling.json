Journal of Software and Systems Modeling, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 159\nAbstract: Most experts agree that large language models (LLMs), such as those used by Copilot and ChatGPT, are expected to revolutionize the way in which software is developed. Many papers are currently devoted to analyzing the potential advantages and limitations of these generative AI models for writing code. However, the analysis of the current state of LLMs with respect to software modeling has received little attention. In this paper, we investigate the current capabilities of ChatGPT to perform modeling tasks and to assist modelers, while also trying to identify its main shortcomings. Our findings show that, in contrast to code generation, the performance of the current version of ChatGPT for software modeling is limited, with various syntactic and semantic deficiencies, lack of consistency in responses and scalability issues. We also outline our views on how we perceive the role that LLMs can play in the software modeling discipline in the short term, and how the modeling community can help to improve the current capabilities of ChatGPT and the coming LLMs for software modeling.",
        "2": "Consistency Models as a Rich and Efficient Policy Class for Reinforcement Learning. Zihan Ding, Chi Jin. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 41\nAbstract: Score-based generative models like the diffusion model have been testified to be effective in modeling multi-modal data from image generation to reinforcement learning (RL). However, the inference process of diffusion model can be slow, which hinders its usage in RL with iterative sampling. We propose to apply the consistency model as an efficient yet expressive policy representation, namely consistency policy, with an actor-critic style algorithm for three typical RL settings: offline, offline-to-online and online. For offline RL, we demonstrate the expressiveness of generative models as policies from multi-modal data. For offline-to-online RL, the consistency policy is shown to be more computational efficient than diffusion policy, with a comparable performance. For online RL, the consistency policy demonstrates significant speedup and even higher average performances than the diffusion policy.",

Entropy, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 25\nAbstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved spectacular performance in many areas of machine learning and generative modeling. While the fundamental ideas behind these models come from non-equilibrium physics, variational inference, and stochastic calculus, in this paper we show that many aspects of these models can be understood using the tools of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Using this reformulation, we show that generative diffusion models undergo second-order phase transitions corresponding to symmetry breaking phenomena. We show that these phase transitions are always in a mean-field universality class, as they are the result of a self-consistency condition in the generative dynamics. We argue that the critical instability arising from these phase transitions lies at the heart of their generative capabilities, which are characterized by a set of mean-field critical exponents. Finally, we show that the dynamic equation of the generative process can be interpreted as a stochastic adiabatic transformation that minimizes the free energy while keeping the system in thermal equilibrium.",

International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 18\nAbstract: Triangular flows, also known as Kn\\\"{o}the-Rosenblatt measure couplings, comprise an important building block of normalizing flow models for generative modeling and density estimation, including popular autoregressive flow models such as real-valued non-volume preserving transformation models (Real NVP). We present statistical guarantees and sample complexity bounds for triangular flow statistical models. In particular, we establish the statistical consistency and the finite sample convergence rates of the Kullback-Leibler estimator of the Kn\\\"{o}the-Rosenblatt measure coupling using tools from empirical process theory. Our results highlight the anisotropic geometry of function classes at play in triangular flows, shed light on optimal coordinate ordering, and lead to statistical guarantees for Jacobian flows. We conduct numerical experiments on synthetic data to illustrate the practical implications of our theoretical findings.",

Neural Information Processing Systems, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 16\nAbstract: Temporally indexed data are essential in a wide range of fields and of interest to machine learning researchers. Time series data, however, are often scarce or highly sensitive, which precludes the sharing of data between researchers and industrial organizations and the application of existing and new data-intensive ML methods. A possible solution to this bottleneck is to generate synthetic data. In this work, we introduce Time Series Generative Modeling (TSGM), an open-source framework for the generative modeling of synthetic time series. TSGM includes a broad repertoire of machine learning methods: generative models, probabilistic, and simulator-based approaches. The framework enables users to evaluate the quality of the produced data from different angles: similarity, downstream effectiveness, predictive consistency, diversity, and privacy. The framework is extensible, which allows researchers to rapidly implement their own methods and compare them in a shareable environment. TSGM was tested on open datasets and in production and proved to be beneficial in both cases. Additionally to the library, the project allows users to employ command line interfaces for synthetic data generation which lowers the entry threshold for those without a programming background.",

IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 11\nAbstract: Synthesizing photo-realistic visual observations from an ego vehicle's driving trajectory is a critical step towards scalable training of self-driving models. Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and in-the-wild driving data demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.",
        "7": "Score Mismatching for Generative Modeling. Senmao Ye, Fei Liu. Neural Networks, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 8\nAbstract: We propose a new score-based model with one-step sampling. Previously, score-based models were burdened with heavy computations due to iterative sampling. For substituting the iterative process, we train a standalone generator to compress all the time steps with the gradient backpropagated from the score network. In order to produce meaningful gradients for the generator, the score network is trained to simultaneously match the real data distribution and mismatch the fake data distribution. This model has the following advantages: (1) For sampling, it generates a fake image with only one step forward. (2) For training, it only needs 10 diffusion steps. (3) Compared with consistency model, it is free of the ill-posed problem caused by consistency loss. On the popular CIFAR-10 dataset, our model outperforms Consistency Model and Denoising Score Matching, which demonstrates the potential of the framework. We further provide more examples on the MINIST and LSUN datasets. The code is available on GitHub.",

International Conference on Learning Representations, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 8\nAbstract: Semantic information refers to the meaning conveyed through words, phrases, and contextual relationships within a given linguistic structure. Humans can leverage semantic information, such as familiar linguistic patterns and contextual cues, to reconstruct incomplete or masked speech signals in noisy environments. However, existing speech enhancement (SE) approaches often overlook the rich semantic information embedded in speech, which is crucial for improving intelligibility, speaker consistency, and overall quality of enhanced speech signals. To enrich the SE model with semantic information, we employ language models as an efficient semantic learner and propose a comprehensive framework tailored for language model-based speech enhancement, called \\textit{GenSE}. Specifically, we approach SE as a conditional language modeling task rather than a continuous signal regression problem defined in existing works. This is achieved by tokenizing speech signals into semantic tokens using a pre-trained self-supervised model and into acoustic tokens using a custom-designed single-quantizer neural codec model. To improve the stability of language model predictions, we propose a hierarchical modeling method that decouples the generation of clean semantic tokens and clean acoustic tokens into two distinct stages. Moreover, we introduce a token chain prompting mechanism during the acoustic token generation stage to ensure timbre consistency throughout the speech enhancement process. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art SE systems in terms of speech quality and generalization capability.",
        "9": "Stable Consistency Tuning: Understanding and Improving Consistency Models. Fu-Yun Wang, Zhengyang Geng, Hongsheng Li. arXiv.org, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 5\nAbstract: Diffusion models achieve superior generation quality but suffer from slow generation speed due to the iterative nature of denoising. In contrast, consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performance with significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either through consistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, or consistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose a novel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoising process of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framing consistency model training as the value estimation through Temporal Difference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyze the limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built upon Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT), which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity. SCT leads to significant performance improvements on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64. On ImageNet-64, SCT achieves 1-step FID 2.42 and 2-step FID 1.55, a new SoTA for consistency models.",
        "10": "Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints. Shangqing Tong, Hengrong Lan, Liming Nie, Jianwen Luo, Fei Gao. arXiv.org, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings."
