        "1": "Estimating Dynamic Treatment Effects in Event Studies With Heterogeneous Treatment Effects. S. Abraham, Liyang Sun. Journal of Econometrics, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 2823\nAbstract: Event studies are frequently used to estimate average treatment effects on the treated (ATT). In estimating the ATT, researchers commonly use fixed effects models that implicitly assume constant treatment effects across cohorts. We show that this is not an innocuous assumption. In fixed effect models where the sole regressor is treatment status, the OLS coefficient is a non-convex average of the heterogeneous cohort-specific ATTs. When regressors containing lags and leads of treatment are added, the OLS coefficient corresponding to a given lead or lag picks up spurious terms consisting of treatment effects from other periods. Therefore, estimates from these commonly used models are not causally interpretable. We propose alternative estimators that identify certain convex averages of the cohort-specific ATTs, hence allowing for causal interpretation even under heterogeneous treatment effects. To illustrate the empirical content of our results, we show that the fixed effects estimators and our proposed estimators differ substantially in an application to the economic consequences of hospitalization.",

Social Science Research Network, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 88\nAbstract: Many of the challenges in the estimation of dynamic heterogeneous treatment effects can be resolved with local projection (LP) estimators of the sort used in applied macroeconometrics. This approach provides a convenient alternative to the more complicated solutions proposed in the recent literature on Difference in-Differences (DiD). The key is to combine LPs with a flexible \u2018clean control\u2019 condition to define appropriate sets of treated and control units. Our proposed LP-DiD estimator is clear, simple, easy and fast to compute, and it is transparent and flexible in its handling of treated and control units. Moreover, it is quite general, including in its ability to control for pre-treatment values of the outcome and of other time-varying covariates. The LP-DiD estimator does not suffer from the negative weighting problem, and indeed can be implemented with any weighting scheme the investigator desires. Simulations demonstrate the good performance of the LP-DiD estimator in common settings. Two recent empirical applications illustrate how LP-DiD addresses the bias of conventional fixed effects estimators, leading to potentially different results.",

Schaar. arXiv.org, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 34\nAbstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment e\ufb00ects is an important problem across many domains. In order to accurately estimate such treatment e\ufb00ects, one typically relies on data from observational studies or randomized experiments. Currently, most existing works rely exclusively on observational data, which is often confounded and, hence, yields biased estimates. While observational data is confounded, randomized data is unconfounded, but its sample size is usually too small to learn heterogeneous treatment e\ufb00ects. In this paper, we propose to estimate heterogeneous treatment e\ufb00ects by combining large amounts of observational data and small amounts of randomized data via representation learning. In particular, we introduce a two-step framework: \ufb01rst, we use observational data to learn a shared structure (in form of a representation); and then, we use randomized data to learn the data-speci\ufb01c structures. We analyze the \ufb01nite sample properties of our framework and compare them to several natural baselines. As such, we derive conditions for when combining observational and randomized data is bene\ufb01cial, and for when it is not. Based on this, we introduce a sample-e\ufb03cient algorithm, called CorNet. We use extensive simulation studies to verify the theoretical properties of CorNet and multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate our method\u2019s superiority compared to existing methods.",

Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 31\nAbstract: We study the problem of inferring heterogeneous treatment effects from time-to-event data. While both the related problems of (i) estimating treatment effects for binary or continuous outcomes and (ii) predicting survival outcomes have been well studied in the recent machine learning literature, their combination -- albeit of high practical relevance -- has received considerably less attention. With the ultimate goal of reliably estimating the effects of treatments on instantaneous risk and survival probabilities, we focus on the problem of learning (discrete-time) treatment-specific conditional hazard functions. We find that unique challenges arise in this context due to a variety of covariate shift issues that go beyond a mere combination of well-studied confounding and censoring biases. We theoretically analyse their effects by adapting recent generalization bounds from domain adaptation and treatment effect estimation to our setting and discuss implications for model design. We use the resulting insights to propose a novel deep learning method for treatment-specific hazard estimation based on balancing representations. We investigate performance across a range of experimental settings and empirically confirm that our method outperforms baselines by addressing covariate shifts from various sources.",
        "5": "Interpreting Event-Studies from Recent Difference-in-Differences Methods. Jonathan Roth. , 2024.\nNumber of citations: 13\nAbstract: This note discusses the interpretation of event-study plots produced by recent difference-in-differences methods. I show that even when specialized to the case of non-staggered treatment timing, the default plots produced by software for three of the most popular recent methods (de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille, 2020; Callaway and SantAnna, 2021; Borusyak, Jaravel and Spiess, 2024) do not match those of traditional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) event-studies: the new methods may show a kink or jump at the time of treatment even when the TWFE event-study shows a straight line. This difference stems from the fact that the new methods construct the pre-treatment coefficients asymmetrically from the post-treatment coefficients. As a result, visual heuristics for analyzing TWFE event-study plots should not be immediately applied to those from these methods. I conclude with practical recommendations for constructing and interpreting event-study plots when using these methods.",
        "6": "Calibration Error for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects. Yizhe Xu, Steve Yadlowsky. International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 12\nAbstract: Recently, many researchers have advanced data-driven methods for modeling heterogeneous treatment e\ufb00ects (HTEs). Even still, estimation of HTEs is a di\ufb03cult task\u2014these methods frequently over- or under-estimate the treatment e\ufb00ects, lead-ing to poor calibration of the resulting models. However, while many methods exist for evaluating the calibration of prediction and classi\ufb01cation models, formal approaches to assess the calibration of HTE models are limited to the calibration slope. In this paper, we de\ufb01ne an analogue of the ( (cid:96) 2 ) expected calibration error for HTEs, and propose a robust estimator. Our approach is motivated by doubly robust treatment e\ufb00ect estimators, making it unbiased, and resilient to confounding, over\ufb01tting, and high-dimensionality issues. Fur-thermore, our method is straightforward to adapt to many structures under which treatment e\ufb00ects can be identi\ufb01ed, including randomized trials, observational studies, and survival analysis. We illustrate how to use our proposed metric to evaluate the calibration of learned HTE models through the application to the CRITEO-UPLIFT Trial.",
        "7": "Event-Studies with a Continuous Treatment. Brantly Callaway, Andrew Goodman-Bacon, Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna. Social Science Research Network, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 11\nAbstract: This paper builds on the identification results and estimation tools for continuous difference-in-difference designs in Callaway, Goodman-Bacon, and Sant'Anna (2024) to discuss aggregation strategies for event studies with continuous treatments. Estimates from continuous designs are functions of the treatment dosage/intensity variable. Nonparametric plots of these functions show heterogeneity across doses but not heterogeneity over time. Event-study-type plots of aggregated parameters achieve the opposite. We describe how partially aggregating across treatment doses and event time can lead to readable yet nuanced figures that reflect how causal effects evolve over time, potentially in different parts of the treatment dose distribution.",
        "8": "Semiparametric Estimation of Treatment Effects in Observational Studies with Heterogeneous Partial Interference. Zhaonan Qu, Ruoxuan Xiong, Jizhou Liu, G. Imbens. , 2021.\nNumber of citations: 10\nAbstract: In many observational studies in social science and medicine, subjects or units are connected, and one unit's treatment and attributes may affect another's treatment and outcome, violating the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) and resulting in interference. To enable feasible estimation and inference, many previous works assume exchangeability of interfering units (neighbors). However, in many applications with distinctive units, interference is heterogeneous and needs to be modeled explicitly. In this paper, we focus on the partial interference setting, and only restrict units to be exchangeable conditional on observable characteristics. Under this framework, we propose generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators for general causal estimands that include heterogeneous direct and spillover effects. We show that they are semiparametric efficient and robust to heterogeneous interference as well as model misspecifications. We apply our methods to the Add Health dataset to study the direct effects of alcohol consumption on academic performance and the spillover effects of parental incarceration on adolescent well-being.",
        "9": "Time-Varying Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Event Studies. Irene Botosaru, Laura Liu. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: This paper examines the identification and estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in event studies, emphasizing the importance of both lagged dependent variables and treatment effect heterogeneity. We show that omitting lagged dependent variables can induce omitted variable bias in the estimated time-varying treatment effects. We develop a novel semiparametric approach based on a short-T dynamic linear panel model with correlated random coefficients, where the time-varying heterogeneous treatment effects can be modeled by a time-series process to reduce dimensionality. We construct a two-step estimator employing quasi-maximum likelihood for common parameters and empirical Bayes for the heterogeneous treatment effects. The procedure is flexible, easy to implement, and achieves ratio optimality asymptotically. Our results also provide insights into common assumptions in the event study literature, such as no anticipation, homogeneous treatment effects across treatment timing cohorts, and state dependence structure.",
