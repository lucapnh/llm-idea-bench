Journal of Econometrics, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 2823\nAbstract: Event studies are frequently used to estimate average treatment effects on the treated (ATT). In estimating the ATT, researchers commonly use fixed effects models that implicitly assume constant treatment effects across cohorts. We show that this is not an innocuous assumption. In fixed effect models where the sole regressor is treatment status, the OLS coefficient is a non-convex average of the heterogeneous cohort-specific ATTs. When regressors containing lags and leads of treatment are added, the OLS coefficient corresponding to a given lead or lag picks up spurious terms consisting of treatment effects from other periods. Therefore, estimates from these commonly used models are not causally interpretable. We propose alternative estimators that identify certain convex averages of the cohort-specific ATTs, hence allowing for causal interpretation even under heterogeneous treatment effects. To illustrate the empirical content of our results, we show that the fixed effects estimators and our proposed estimators differ substantially in an application to the economic consequences of hospitalization.",

Social Science Research Network, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 88\nAbstract: Many of the challenges in the estimation of dynamic heterogeneous treatment effects can be resolved with local projection (LP) estimators of the sort used in applied macroeconometrics. This approach provides a convenient alternative to the more complicated solutions proposed in the recent literature on Difference in-Differences (DiD). The key is to combine LPs with a flexible \u2018clean control\u2019 condition to define appropriate sets of treated and control units. Our proposed LP-DiD estimator is clear, simple, easy and fast to compute, and it is transparent and flexible in its handling of treated and control units. Moreover, it is quite general, including in its ability to control for pre-treatment values of the outcome and of other time-varying covariates. The LP-DiD estimator does not suffer from the negative weighting problem, and indeed can be implemented with any weighting scheme the investigator desires. Simulations demonstrate the good performance of the LP-DiD estimator in common settings. Two recent empirical applications illustrate how LP-DiD addresses the bias of conventional fixed effects estimators, leading to potentially different results.",

Schaar. arXiv.org, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 34\nAbstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment e\ufb00ects is an important problem across many domains. In order to accurately estimate such treatment e\ufb00ects, one typically relies on data from observational studies or randomized experiments. Currently, most existing works rely exclusively on observational data, which is often confounded and, hence, yields biased estimates. While observational data is confounded, randomized data is unconfounded, but its sample size is usually too small to learn heterogeneous treatment e\ufb00ects. In this paper, we propose to estimate heterogeneous treatment e\ufb00ects by combining large amounts of observational data and small amounts of randomized data via representation learning. In particular, we introduce a two-step framework: \ufb01rst, we use observational data to learn a shared structure (in form of a representation); and then, we use randomized data to learn the data-speci\ufb01c structures. We analyze the \ufb01nite sample properties of our framework and compare them to several natural baselines. As such, we derive conditions for when combining observational and randomized data is bene\ufb01cial, and for when it is not. Based on this, we introduce a sample-e\ufb03cient algorithm, called CorNet. We use extensive simulation studies to verify the theoretical properties of CorNet and multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate our method\u2019s superiority compared to existing methods.",

Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 31\nAbstract: We study the problem of inferring heterogeneous treatment effects from time-to-event data. While both the related problems of (i) estimating treatment effects for binary or continuous outcomes and (ii) predicting survival outcomes have been well studied in the recent machine learning literature, their combination -- albeit of high practical relevance -- has received considerably less attention. With the ultimate goal of reliably estimating the effects of treatments on instantaneous risk and survival probabilities, we focus on the problem of learning (discrete-time) treatment-specific conditional hazard functions. We find that unique challenges arise in this context due to a variety of covariate shift issues that go beyond a mere combination of well-studied confounding and censoring biases. We theoretically analyse their effects by adapting recent generalization bounds from domain adaptation and treatment effect estimation to our setting and discuss implications for model design. We use the resulting insights to propose a novel deep learning method for treatment-specific hazard estimation based on balancing representations. We investigate performance across a range of experimental settings and empirically confirm that our method outperforms baselines by addressing covariate shifts from various sources.",

Clinical Trials, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 11\nAbstract: There has been much interest in the evaluation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and multiple statistical methods have emerged under the heading of personalized/precision medicine combining ideas from hypothesis testing, causal inference, and machine learning over the past 10-15 years. We discuss new ideas and approaches for evaluating HTE in randomized clinical trials and observational studies using the features introduced earlier by Lipkovich, Dmitrienko, and D\u2019Agostino that distinguish principled methods from simplistic approaches to data-driven subgroup identification and estimating individual treatment effects and use a case study to illustrate these approaches. We identified and provided a high-level overview of several classes of modern statistical approaches for personalized/precision medicine, elucidated the underlying principles and challenges, and compared findings for a case study across different methods. Different approaches to evaluating HTEs may produce (and actually produced) highly disparate results when applied to a specific data set. Evaluating HTE with machine learning methods presents special challenges since most of machine learning algorithms are optimized for prediction rather than for estimating causal effects. An additional challenge is in that the output of machine learning methods is typically a \u201cblack box\u201d that needs to be transformed into interpretable personalized solutions in order to gain acceptance and usability.",

Montez-Rath, P. Geldsetzer, Ian H. de Boer, Lu Tian, M. Tamura. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 5\nAbstract: Visual Abstract Significance Statement Identifying and quantifying treatment effect variation across patients is the fundamental challenge of precision medicine. Here we quantify heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glycemic control in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, considering three outcomes of interest\u2014a composite kidney outcome (driven by macroalbuminuria), all-cause mortality, and first assisted hypoglycemic event. We demonstrate that the effects of intensive glycemic control vary with risk of kidney failure, as predicted by the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE). Participants at highest risk of kidney failure gain the largest absolute kidney benefit of intensive glycemic control but also experience the largest absolute risk of death and hypoglycemic events. Our findings illustrate the value of identifying clinically meaningful treatment heterogeneity, particularly when treatments have different effects on multiple end points. Objective Clear criteria to individualize glycemic targets in patients with type II diabetes are lacking. In this post hoc analysis of the ACCORD, we evaluate whether the KFRE can identify patients for whom intensive glycemic control confers more benefit in preventing kidney microvascular outcomes. Research Design and Methods We divided the ACCORD trial population into quartiles on the basis of 5-year kidney failure risk using the KFRE. We estimated conditional treatment effects within each quartile and compared them with the average treatment effect in the trial. The treatment effects of interest were the 7-year restricted mean survival time (RMST) differences between intensive and standard glycemic control arms on (1) time-to-first development of severely elevated albuminuria or kidney failure and (2) all-cause mortality. Results We found evidence that the effect of intensive glycemic control on kidney microvascular outcomes and all-cause mortality varies with baseline risk of kidney failure. Patients with elevated baseline risk of kidney failure derived the most from intensive glycemic control in reducing kidney microvascular outcomes (7-year RMST difference of 114.8 [95% confidence interval 58.1 to 176.4] versus 48.4 [25.3 to 69.6] days in the entire trial population) However, this same patient group also experienced a shorter time to death (7-year RMST difference of \u221256.7 [\u2212100.2 to \u221217.5] v. \u221223.6 [\u221242.2 to \u22126.6] days). Conclusions We found evidence of heterogenous treatment effects of intensive glycemic control on kidney microvascular outcomes in ACCORD as a function of predicted baseline risk of kidney failure. Patients with higher kidney failure risk experienced the most pronounced reduction in kidney microvascular outcomes but also experienced the highest risk of all-cause mortality.",

Irene Botosaru, Laura Liu. , 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: This paper examines the identification and estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in event studies, emphasizing the importance of both lagged dependent variables and treatment effect heterogeneity. We show that omitting lagged dependent variables can induce omitted variable bias in the estimated time-varying treatment effects. We develop a novel semiparametric approach based on a short-T dynamic linear panel model with correlated random coefficients, where the time-varying heterogeneous treatment effects can be modeled by a time-series process to reduce dimensionality. We construct a two-step estimator employing quasi-maximum likelihood for common parameters and empirical Bayes for the heterogeneous treatment effects. The procedure is flexible, easy to implement, and achieves ratio optimality asymptotically. Our results also provide insights into common assumptions in the event study literature, such as no anticipation, homogeneous treatment effects across treatment timing cohorts, and state dependence structure.",
