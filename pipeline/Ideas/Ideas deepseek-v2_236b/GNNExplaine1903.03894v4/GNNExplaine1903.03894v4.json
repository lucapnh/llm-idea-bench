        "Short Hypothesis": "To enhance interpretability, we hypothesize that a systematic approach combining structural and semantic analysis can reveal the cognitive architecture underlying GNN predictions.",
        "Related Work": "While existing efforts like GNNExplainer provide post-hoc explanations by highlighting relevant subgraphs and features, there is a gap in understanding how these elements interact within the network's internal processing. Our proposal refines this approach by focusing on a pragmatic analysis that targets both the structural representation learned by GNNs and their semantic interpretation of graph data.",
        "Abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant advancements but remain opaque in terms of understanding their decision-making processes. The GNNCognitiveLens proposes an integrated framework to dissect these networks through a dual lens: one that examines the structural learning patterns and another that probes into the semantic meaning attributed to graph elements by the network. By employing a combination of graph theory, information theory, and feature attribution techniques, our approach aims to create a 'cognitive blueprint' that not only explains individual predictions but also provides insights into how GNNs interpret and process complex relational data structures. This framework is designed to be model-agnostic, making it applicable across various GNN architectures, thus enhancing its utility for researchers and practitioners in validating, debugging, and improving trust in these powerful yet enigmatic models.",
