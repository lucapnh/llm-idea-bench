        "Short Hypothesis": "A unified consistency model that leverages shared latent spaces across modalities can enable efficient one-step generation and zero-shot editing, outperforming existing multi-modal fusion methods.",
        "Related Work": "Recent advances in generative modeling have explored the unification of different domains within a single framework (e.g., UniHDA, M\u00b3amba). However, these approaches often focus on specific tasks or maintain separate pathways for each modality, lacking a fully integrated approach that enforces consistency across all modalities while enabling one-step generation and zero-shot editing.",
        "Abstract": "This proposal introduces UniCoGen, an innovative framework that unifies consistency models to enable efficient multi-modal synthesis. By training a single network with shared latent spaces for diverse modalities such as images, audio, and text, we aim to achieve high-quality one-step generation across domains. Our approach will employ a novel distillation process that leverages pre-trained diffusion models while enforcing cross-modal consistency through a unified embedding space. We hypothesize that UniCoGen will outperform existing multi-modal fusion methods by providing superior synthesis quality with the added benefit of zero-shot editing capabilities. To validate our claims, we will conduct experiments on benchmark datasets across modalities to evaluate generation quality using appropriate metrics (e.g., FID for images, SNR for audio, perplexity for text). Additionally, we will demonstrate UniCoGen's versatility through tasks such as style transfer between different domains and zero-shot editing of synthesized content.",

By integrating features at multiple scales into a single model, we aim to achieve high-quality generation with the ability to adapt seamlessly from low-resolution to high-resolution synthesis. Our refined approach will detail a novel training scheme that enforces consistency between feature representations at each scale, allowing for efficient scaling without compromising quality.

By incorporating OT into the training process, we aim to guide the mapping between latent spaces of different datasets or styles while maintaining semantic coherence. Our refined method will detail a novel integration of OT constraints within consistency modeling, allowing for direct single-step generation that is both high quality and style-aware. We hypothesize that HarmonizedGenerativeODE will outperform existing models in terms of generation speed without sacrificing control over the stylization across various datasets. To validate our claims, we plan to conduct experiments on diverse benchmark datasets to assess generation quality using metrics such as FID and style consistency measures.
