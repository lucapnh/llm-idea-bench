Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 50\nAbstract: Performing data assimilation (DA) at low cost is of prime concern in Earth system modeling, particularly in the era of Big Data, where huge quantities of observations are available. Capitalizing on the ability of neural network techniques to approximate the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), we incorporate deep learning (DL) methods into a DA framework. More precisely, we exploit the latent structure provided by autoencoders (AEs) to design an ensemble transform Kalman filter with model error (ETKF\u2010Q) in the latent space. Model dynamics are also propagated within the latent space via a surrogate neural network. This novel ETKF\u2010Q\u2010Latent (ETKF\u2010Q\u2010L) algorithm is tested on a tailored instructional version of Lorenz 96 equations, named the augmented Lorenz 96 system, which possesses a latent structure that accurately represents the observed dynamics. Numerical experiments based on this particular system evidence that the ETKF\u2010Q\u2010L approach both reduces the computational cost and provides better accuracy than state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art algorithms such as the ETKF\u2010Q.",

Monthly Weather Review, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 23\nAbstract: \nRemote sensing data play a critical role in improving numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, the physical principles of radiation dictate that data voids frequently exist in physical space (e.g., sub-cloud area for satellite infrared radiance or no-precipitation region for radar reflectivity). Such data gaps impair the accuracy of initial conditions derived from data assimilation (DA), which has a negative impact on NWP. We use the barotropic vorticity equation to demonstrate the potential of deep learning augmented data assimilation (DDA), which involves reconstructing spatially complete pseudo-observation fields from incomplete observations and using them for DA. By training a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) with a long simulation at a coarse \u201cforecast\u201d resolution (T63), we obtained a deep-learning approximation of the \u201creconstruction operator,\u201d which maps spatially incomplete observations to a model state with full spatial coverage and resolution. The CAE was applied to an incomplete stream function observation (\u223c30% missing) from a high-resolution benchmark simulation and demonstrated satisfactory reconstruction performance, even when only very sparse (1/16 of T63 grid density) observations were used as input. When only spatially incomplete observations are used, the analysis fields obtained from Ensemble Square Root Filter (EnSRF) assimilation exhibit significant error. However, in DDA, when EnSRF takes in the combined data from the incomplete observations and CAE reconstruction, analysis error reduces significantly. Such gains are more pronounced with sparse observation and small ensemble size because the DDA analysis is much less sensitive to observation density and ensemble size than the conventional DA analysis, which is based solely on incomplete observations.",

Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 10\nAbstract: The accuracy of initial conditions is an important driver of the forecast skill of numerical weather prediction models. Increases in the quantity of available measurements, particularly high\u2010resolution remote sensing observational data products from satellites, are valuable inputs for improving those initial condition estimates. However, the traditional data assimilation methods for integrating observations into forecast models are computationally expensive. This makes incorporating dense observations into operational forecast systems challenging, and it is often prohibitively time\u2010consuming. Additionally, high\u2010resolution observations often have correlated observation errors which are difficult to estimate and create problems for assimilation systems. As a result, large quantities of data are discarded and not used for state initialization. Using the Lorenz\u201096 system for testing, we demonstrate that a simple machine learning method can be trained to assimilate high\u2010resolution data. Using it to do so improves both initial conditions and forecast accuracy. Compared to using the Ensemble Kalman Filter with high\u2010resolution observations ignored, our augmented method has an average root\u2010mean\u2010squared error reduced by 37%. Ensemble forecasts using initial conditions generated by the augmented method are more accurate and reliable at up to 10 days of forecast lead time.",

Chenglong Cao, Jiangjiang Zhang, Wei Gan, Tongchao Nan, Chunhui Lu. Water Resources Research, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 8\nAbstract: Seawater intrusion (SI) poses a substantial threat to water security in coastal regions, where numerical models play a pivotal role in supporting groundwater management and protection. However, the inherent heterogeneity of coastal aquifers introduces significant uncertainties into SI predictions, potentially diminishing their effectiveness in management decisions. Data assimilation (DA) offers a solution by integrating various types of observational data with the model to characterize heterogeneous coastal aquifers. Traditional DA techniques, like ensemble smoother using the Kalman formula (ESK) and Markov chain Monte Carlo, face challenges when confronted with the non\u2010linearity, non\u2010Gaussianity, and high\u2010dimensionality issues commonly encountered in aquifer characterization. In this study, we introduce a novel DA approach rooted in deep learning (DL), referred to as ESDL, aimed at effectively characterizing coastal aquifers with varying levels of heterogeneity. We systematically investigate a range of factors that impact the performance of ESDL, including the number and types of observations, the degree of aquifer heterogeneity, the structure and training options of the DL models. Our findings reveal that ESDL excels in characterizing heterogeneous aquifers under non\u2010linear and non\u2010Gaussian conditions. Comparison between ESDL and ESK under different experimentation settings underscores the robustness of ESDL. Conversely, in certain scenarios, ESK displays noticeable biases in the characterization results, especially when measurement data from non\u2010linear and discontinuous processes are used. To optimize the efficacy of ESDL, attention must be given to the design of the DL model and the selection of observational data, which are crucial to ensure the universal applicability of this DA method.",

IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: The accuracy of the initial field is crucial to the forecast results of numerical weather prediction (NWP). Data assimilation (DA) is a method to provide the initial field to the NWP. Currently, the hybrid 4DVar-EnKF DA method is the primary DA method used by operational NWP centres. The technique requires the derivation of the tangent linear and adjoint models for the nonlinear model, but it\u2019s challenging to get the tangent linear and the adjoint models. Furthermore, this method usually adopts empirical coefficients to combine the four-dimensional variational assimilation (4DVar) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which reduces the accuracy of assimilation results. This paper builds a hybrid DA system based on a deep learning model (DL-HDA) in response to the above problems. First, we establish a forecast model based on the bilinear neural network (BNN) and use the tangent linear and adjoint models of the BNN for the 4DVar. Then, we utilize the ResNet model to combine the analysis of the 4DVar and the EnKF. The experiments are carried out on the Lorenz-96 model, and then the DL-HDA is compared with the traditional method. The experimental results show that the DL-HDA can improve the precision of assimilation results and decrease the system\u2019s running time.",

Dan MacKinlay, Russell Tsuchida, Dan Pagendam, Petra Kuhnert. arXiv.org, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Efficient inference in high-dimensional models is a central challenge in machine learning. We introduce the Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation (GEnBP) algorithm, which combines the strengths of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP) to address this challenge. GEnBP updates ensembles of prior samples into posterior samples by passing low-rank local messages over the edges of a graphical model, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional states, parameters, and complex, noisy, black-box generation processes. By utilizing local message passing within a graphical model structure, GEnBP effectively manages complex dependency structures and remains computationally efficient even when the ensemble size is much smaller than the inference dimension -- a common scenario in spatiotemporal modeling, image processing, and physical model inversion. We demonstrate that GEnBP can be applied to various problem structures, including data assimilation, system identification, and hierarchical models, and show through experiments that it outperforms existing belief propagation methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

        "8": "An Online Paleoclimate Data Assimilation With a Deep Learning\u2010Based Network. Haohao Sun, Lili Lei, Zhengyu Liu, Liang Ning, Zhe\u2010Min Tan. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 2025.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: An online paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) that utilizes climate forecasts from a deep learning\u2010based network (NET) along with assimilation of proxies to reconstruct surface air temperature, is investigated here. The NET is trained on ensemble simulations from the Community Earth System Model\u2010Last Millennium Ensemble. Due to the nonlinear features with high\u2010dimensional input, NET gains better predictive skills compared to the linear inverse model (LIM) in a reduced empirical orthogonal function (EOF) space. Thus, an alternative for online PDA is to couple the NET with the integrated hybrid ensemble Kalman filter (IHEnKF). Moreover, an analog blending strategy is proposed to increase ensemble spread and mitigate filter divergence, which blends the analog ensembles selected from climatological samples based on proxies and cycling ensembles advanced by NET. To account for the underestimated uncertainties of real proxy data, an observation error inflation method is applied, which inflates the proxy error variance based on the comparison between the estimated proxy error variance and its climatological innovation. Consistent results are obtained from the pseudoproxy experiments and the real proxy experiments. The more informative ensemble priors from the online PDA using NET enhance the reconstructions than the online PDA using LIM, and both outperform the offline PDA with randomly sampled climatological ensemble priors. The advantages of online PDA with NET over the online PDA with LIM and offline PDA become more pronounced, as the proxy data become sparser.",
        "9": "A competitive baseline for deep learning enhanced data assimilation using conditional Gaussian ensemble Kalman filtering. Zachariah Malik, R. Maulik. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional Gaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional multiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.",

Qianlong Jin, Yu Tian, Qiming Sang, Weicong Zhan, Jiancheng Yu, Xiaohui Wang. Oceans, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-resolution and accurate prediction of the states of ocean temperature, salinity, and flow fields with the observation of a network of marine vehicles are significant for a variety of civilian and military applications. Relative to the high-dimensional ocean states, the observations by the marine vehicles are sparse and noisy. Thus, how to implement high-resolution and accurate prediction of the oceanographic fields spatially and temporally based on the sparse and noisy data streams provided by a marine vehicle network is an important issue. This paper investigates this issue and presents a data-driven prediction framework, which uses a deep neural network model to predict the mean-field of the ocean states and the Gaussian process to predict the residual. Based on the model, the Kriged Kalman filter method is used to update the network parameters and to predict the ocean states with sensing data of marine vehicles. The deep learning model is based on the ConvLSTM and considers the joint prediction of temperature, salinity, and flow fields. To account for the high-dimension of the network parameters, the filtering is implemented with the ensemble Kalman filter. A simulation demonstration is given to show the learning of the deep neural network parameters with the data assimilation method."
