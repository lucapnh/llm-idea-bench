Jihao Zhao, Zhiyuan Ji, Yuchen Feng, Pengnian Qi, Simin Niu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li. , 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for boosting large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks, it often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its workflow. This paper proposes the Meta-Chunking framework, which specifically enhances chunking quality through a dual strategy that identifies optimal segmentation points and preserves global information. Initially, breaking limitations of similarity-based chunking, we design two adaptive chunking techniques based on uncertainty, namely Perplexity Chunking and Margin Sampling Chunking, by utilizing the logical perception capabilities of LLMs. Given the inherent complexity across different texts, we integrate meta-chunk with dynamic merging, striking a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Furthermore, we establish the global information compensation mechanism, encompassing a two-stage hierarchical summary generation process and a three-stage text chunk rewriting procedure focused on missing reflection, refinement, and completion. These components collectively strengthen the semantic integrity and contextual coherence of chunks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Meta-Chunking effectively addresses challenges of the chunking task within the RAG system, providing LLMs with more logically coherent text chunks. Additionally, our methodology validates the feasibility of implementing high-quality chunking tasks with smaller-scale models, thereby eliminating the reliance on robust instruction-following capabilities.",

Mansoureh Motahari Nezhad, Maysam Avakh Kisomi, Fatemeh Gholinezhad. 2025 11th International Conference on Web Research (ICWR), 2025.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Recent advances in persuasive communication and conversational AI have driven the development of adaptive frameworks that integrate dynamic strategy adjustment within large language model architectures. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that effectively integrates real-time sentiment analysis with comprehensive personality profiling based on the Big Five model to enable adaptive strategy switching during multi-turn dialogues. Our methodology also leverages a reinforcement learning-inspired weight adaptation mechanism that continuously readjusts the relative influence of stable personality traits and transient emotional states, thereby optimizing the selection of persuasive techniques. Furthermore, by incorporating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm alongside the LLaMA model, the proposed framework produces contextually coherent and individually tailored responses that draw upon historical interaction data and strategic knowledge repositories. Experimental evaluations reveal that our adaptive system significantly enhances persuasive efficacy and user engagement, underscoring its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in personalized conversational agents.",
