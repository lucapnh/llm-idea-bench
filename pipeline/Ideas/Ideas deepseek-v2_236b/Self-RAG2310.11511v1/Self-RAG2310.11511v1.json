        "Title": "Integrating Dynamic Retrieval Policies and Self-Evaluation for Enhanced Language Model Performance",
        "Short Hypothesis": "By training a language model to dynamically adjust retrieval strategies based on task requirements, and by incorporating self-evaluation tokens that guide the use of retrieved information, we can achieve superior performance in terms of factuality, citation precision, and controllability.",
        "Related Work": "Building upon RAG models and SELF-RAG's reflection tokens, our proposal introduces a novel approach where the language model learns to adapt retrieval based on task complexity. Unlike existing models that either retrieve fixed passages or rely on separate critics, AdaptiveRetrievalLM_v2 integrates dynamic retrieval policies with self-evaluation for an end-to-end solution.",
        "Abstract": "This research aims to develop AdaptiveRetrievalLM_v2, a language model that dynamically adjusts its information retrieval based on task complexity and incorporates self-evaluation tokens to guide the use of retrieved evidence. The model will be trained in two stages: first, using domain-specific expert annotations or high-quality existing datasets to learn dynamic retrieval policies; second, fine-tuning the main language model with these policies to ensure both efficient retrieval and accurate generation. We hypothesize that by enabling adaptive retrieval and self-evaluation, AdaptiveRetrievalLM_v2 will outperform current models on benchmarks measuring factuality, citation precision, and controllability without compromising fluency. The proposed model's performance will be evaluated across a range of tasks to ensure generalizability.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Integrating a meta-learning framework that adapts retrieval strategies based on real-time user feedback will significantly improve the factual accuracy and adaptability of language models across various knowledge domains.",
        "Related Work": "Building upon existing research in retrieval-augmented generation, our refined proposal for MetaRetrievalCritic_refined introduces a meta-learning approach that leverages user interactions to dynamically refine its knowledge sourcing. This distinguishes from prior work by directly incorporating real-time feedback into the learning process, enabling the model to adaptively improve factual accuracy.",

The model will be trained in two phases: first, it will establish foundational retrieval strategies; second, it will adapt these strategies using user interactions as feedback signals. By integrating this innovative approach with an adaptive feedback mechanism, MetaRetrievalCritic_refined is anticipated to excel on benchmarks that measure factual accuracy and adaptability without sacrificing response fluency. The model's performance will be evaluated across a broad spectrum of tasks to ensure its effectiveness in diverse knowledge domains.",
