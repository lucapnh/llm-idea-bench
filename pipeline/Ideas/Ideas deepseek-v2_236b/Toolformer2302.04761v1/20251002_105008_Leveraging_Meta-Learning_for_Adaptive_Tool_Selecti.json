Journal of Practitioner Research, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: This collaborative self-study of teacher educators\u2019 feedback practices argues for an intentional process for teacher educators to develop an inquiry stance toward our own teaching. Data sources include formative observation forms, evaluations, observation notes, debriefings, surveys, researcher journals, and layered memos. Findings define influences and shared patterns of practice. Our professional learning from this self-study built our capacity as teacher educators by informing our development of an inquiry feedback cycle rooted in representations, approximations, and decomposition of practice (Grossman et al., 2009) to intentionally model and scaffold the development of an inquiry stance toward practice in our teacher candidates. Cochran-Smith and Lytle (1993) introduced the concept of an \u201cinquiry stance\u201d as a professional orientation that teachers could leverage to not only withstand, but thrive, in an often-tumultuous climate of ongoing educational reform. They defined inquiry stance as \u201cthe position teachers and others who work together in inquiry communities take toward knowledge and its relationships to practice\u201d (p. 288). Inquiry stance as a tool is particularly powerful because the orientation fosters educators\u2019 ongoing professional learning across their career trajectories (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 1993; 2001; 2009; Crocco, Faithfull, & Schwartz, 2003). Wolkenhauer and Hooser (2017) argue that developing an inquiry stance in teacher candidates (TCs) is essential to supporting them as new teachers because inquiry can be used as a \u201ctool\u201d to build teachers\u2019 flexibility, advocacy, leadership, and professional identity (pp. 9-10). As teacher educators, we asked How could we build our own capacity to model an inquiry stance for our TCs? We explored that question by engaging in professional inquiry. Often, without a clear pedagogy of teacher education (Cochran-Smith, 2003), new teacher educators are left to rely on preparing teachers in the same ways they taught their K-12 students (Cuenca, 2010). Given the meaningful differences in the instructional context and needs of post-secondary and K-12 students, teacher educators need to build capacity to adapt their teaching practice to higher education (Neumann, 2014). Moreover, increasing attention to the performance of teacher preparation programs and teacher quality is generating a heightened need for research into the professional learning of teacher educators to build capacity to teach postsecondary students in teacher preparation programs (Williams, 2014). Meta-analyses on faculty learning for postsecondary teaching 1 Dismuke et al.: Building Capacity in Teacher Preparation with Practitioner Inquiry Published by Scholar Commons, 2019 call for more qualitative research that utilizes a plethora of data sources (Levinson-Rose & Menges, 1981; Steinert et al., 2006; Stes, Min-Leliveld, Gijbels, & Van Petegem, 2010); more robust descriptive language of practice to serve as a foundation for future inquiry (Stes et al., 2010); and a more holistic examination of professional learning efforts to better understand the potential of specific practices (Amundsen & Wilson, 2012). As teacher educators and full-time faculty, we took up these calls in this collaborative self-study. In particular, we saw this self-study as an opportunity to develop our own inquiry stances and to build capacity to foster that professional habit in our TCs. We utilized a collaborative self-study approach to our practitioner inquiry to illustrate how the experience taught us about our own practice, to inform our theorizing about teacher preparation, and to allow us to more systematically model what it look likes to take an inquiry stance toward teaching and learning. We also strived to contribute a rich, holistic description of a case of faculty learning about teaching that focuses on a promising teaching framework, drawing on a theory from the more developed field of K-12 teacher education (Amundsen & Wilson, 2012; Neumann, 2014). Our self-study focused on giving TCs feedback during their clinical field experience, since research suggests that feedback is a particularly powerful teaching practice (Hattie & Timperley, 2007) and field supervision is a fruitful context to engage in practitioner inquiry (Zeichner, 2010). As teacher educators, we view feedback as a critical mechanism that bridges TCs\u2019 learning in university coursework and their classroom placements, answering over two decades of scholarship and policy calling for teacher educators to ground teacher preparation in instructional practice (Ball & Cohen, 1999; Conway & Munthe, 2015; Jenset, Klette, & Hammerness, 2017; Zeichner, 2012). Mindful of this need, we engaged in self-study to examine our own clinical feedback practices to: ...transcend the practicalities (and limitations) of discrete teaching skills and tools gained from previous teaching experience; and develop ways of thinking about and approaching teaching and learning that promote the application of a professional repertoire to a vast array of dilemmas, most of which cannot possibly be anticipated beforehand (Goodwin & Kosnik, 2013, p. 337). Investigating our practice of giving feedback to TCs contributes to the understanding of skilled teacher education by investigating a central practice and its enactment in the field (Pinnegar & Hamilton, 2009). We asked, \u25cf What do we, as teacher educators, learn about our own feedback and feedback practices after analysis of our own feedback, that of our peers, and our teacher candidates\u2019 perceptions of our feedback? 2 Journal of Practitioner Research, Vol. 4 [2019], Iss. 1, Art. 5 https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jpr/vol4/iss1/5 DOI: <p>https://doi.org/10.5038/2379-9951.4.1.1095</p> \u25cf How does participation in this collaborative self-study build our capacity as teacher educators to model and engage candidates in taking an inquiry stance toward practice? Theoretical Framework This self-study is framed by the mission to develop and maintain an inquiry stance within a community of practice by taking a critical lens toward our opportunities to teach practice through the clinical feedback cycle to our TCs. Inquiry Stance in Communities of Practice Exploring the connections between classroom teaching and teacher education practices is a complex endeavor (Martin & Dismuke, 2018; Cochran\u2010 Smith et al., 2016; Davis & Sumara, 2006; Grossman et al., 2009). Teacher education programs that emphasize an inquiry stance toward teaching and teacher education provide spaces for teacher educators to unpack complexity by making \u201cproblematic their own knowledge and practice as well as knowledge and practice of others and thus stand in a different relationship to knowledge and action\u201d (Cochran\u2010Smith & Lytle, 2009, p. 614). We agree with Hamilton (2009) that, while individual reflection is beneficial, learning in small groups may enhance the social construction of teaching knowledge, resulting in more substantial change in practice. We adopted Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder\u2019s (2002) definition of a community of practice: a group of people \u201cwho share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis\u201d (p. 4). Investigating complexities of clinical experiences together provides opportunities for \u201cboth individuals and the collective to develop new and shared understandings\u201d (Martin, Snow, & Torrez, 2011, p. 300), advancing our faculty learning goals. Teaching Practice Utilizing Representations, Decomposition, and Approximations We explored the theory that teacher education programs could improve the teaching of instructional practice if we provide scaffolding through representations, decomposition, and approximations of practice (Grossman et al., 2009). Representations of practice deal explicitly with the problem of familiarity by making less familiar and more challenging components of the work visible (Grossman et al., 2009). Thus, the selection of representations for clinical teacher education is a significant one since those representations will shape novice awareness of the landscape of practice and foster a nuanced view of practice. The decomposition of practice \u201cinvolves breaking down practice into its constituent parts for the purposes of teaching and learning\u201d (Grossman et al., 2009, p. 2056). 3 Dismuke et al.: Building Capacity in Teacher Preparation with Practitioner Inquiry Published by Scholar Commons, 2019 Through the decomposition of larger, complex components of practice into smaller, more manageable parts, teacher educators can help novices better manage the complexity of practice. Approximations of practice provide novices with the opportunity to practice in front of an expert (e.g., teacher educators). These first enactments of practice are understood as carefully constructed opportunities for novices to practice components of teaching, in their decomposed or recomposed forms, in contexts that vary in their degree of authenticity (Grossman et al.). Grossman et al. (2009) argue that the integration of representations, decomposition, and approximations of practice are critical in teacher education to support TCs in becoming well-started beginning teachers. In our clinical context, we considered what this integration might look like in debriefing conferences between supervisors and TCs. In other words, how might those conferences change if we deliberately attended to the integration of representations and decompositions of practice to examine the teaching just observed and then considering the feedback informing TCs\u2019 future approximations of practice? We decided as a community of practitioners to begin our inquiry into our feedback practices by examining our extant practices using Grossman and colleagues\u2019 teaching of practice as one of our lenses to guide our analysis of our collaborative self-study inquiry data.",
