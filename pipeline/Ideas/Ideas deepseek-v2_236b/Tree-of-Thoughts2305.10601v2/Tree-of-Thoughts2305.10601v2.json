        "Description": "Despite their impressive reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often falter when faced with complex tasks that require specific thinking paradigms such as divide-and-conquer and procedural deduction. The root challenge lies in the lack of computational thinking within LLMs during reasoning. To address this issue, we propose integrating a Computational Thinking Model (CTM) into LLMs to enable them to break down complex problems using techniques like decomposition, abstraction, reduction, and simulation. This will be achieved through tailored reinforcement learning rewards that encourage problem simplification, modular planning, and iterative verification.",

LADAR introduces an adaptive layer that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning strategies based on continuous evaluations using domain-specific heuristics and machine learning.
