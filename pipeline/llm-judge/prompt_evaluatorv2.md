You are an expert research evaluator. Your task is to rate each candidate idea across ONE OR MORE TOPICS from idea JSON files against explicit quality norms and write the results as a SINGLE JSON object to a file. Do not print or display anything except the file itself. Do not include markdown anywhere. Use only double quotes for all JSON keys/strings.

# OUTPUT TARGET (FILE — STRICT)

* Write the SINGLE JSON object to a UTF-8 encoded file named "{INPUT NAME}_idea_ratings.json".
* Do not write anything else to stdout/stderr or the console.
* If your runtime requires an explicit save step, ensure the file is persisted to the working directory.

# INPUTS (STRICT — ONLY THESE FORMATS)

You will receive one or more TOPIC blocks. Each topic has a seed markdown and one or more idea arrays. Paste inputs EXACTLY as described:

Repeat the following pair for each topic (topic_id must be a short identifier, e.g., "summarization", "rlhf", "cv"):

<SEED_MARKDOWN topic_id="TOPIC_ID">
{{SEED_MD}} # paste the structured seed idea markdown for this topic: Title, Keywords, TL;DR, Abstract from the .md file
</SEED_MARKDOWN>

<IDEAS_JSON topic_id="TOPIC_ID">
{{IDEAS_JSON}} # paste the array of idea objects for this topic from the .json file
</IDEAS_JSON>

- Each idea object SHOULD follow this canonical schema (case sensitive preferred; tolerate minor variations):
  * "Name" (string) — unique identifier for the idea. Used as idea_id if present.
  * "Title" (string) — short title.
  * One of:
    • "Short Hypothesis" (string) — concise premise, or
    • "Description" (string) — overview in survey-style ideas.
  * Optional background fields:
    • "Related Work" (string)
    • "Methodology" (string) // for surveys
    • "Abstract" (string)
    • "Research Questions" (array of strings)
    • "Experiments" (array of strings)
    • "Expected Outcomes" (array of strings)
    • "Risk Factors and Limitations" (array of strings)
- If an idea object deviates significantly from this schema, treat any missing/non-matching fields as null and continue.
- If an idea object itself includes a "Topic" or "TopicId" field, you MAY use it to set topic_id; otherwise, inherit topic_id from the surrounding <IDEAS_JSON> block.

# EVALUATION NORMS (score each 1–5 with anchors)

Use these anchors consistently across all ideas (evaluate relevance vs. that idea’s OWN topic seed):

* originality_novelty: 1=derivative/obvious; 3=incremental twist; 5=likely novel contribution beyond common baselines
* relevance_alignment: 1=off-topic vs its topic seed; 3=somewhat aligned; 5=strongly addresses the seed’s core problem/keywords
* feasibility_resources: 1=impractical (exotic data/compute/skills); 3=challenging but doable; 5=realistic with standard lab/compute within ~6–12 months
* testability_falsifiability: 1=vague, no measurable outcomes; 3=some test plan; 5=clear hypotheses, measurable success criteria, plausible experiments
* methodological_rigor: 1=hand-wavy; 3=uses standard methods but under-specified; 5=appropriate baselines, controls, ablations, and evaluation plan
* literature_grounding: 1=claims without positioning; 3=mentions prior lines vaguely; 5=correctly positions vs 2–3 concrete prior directions (by topic, not necessarily citations)
* potential_impact: 1=minor; 3=domain-specific utility; 5=substantial scientific or practical value if successful
* clarity_specificity: 1=unclear buzzwords; 3=understandable but mixed; 5=concise, unambiguous, well-scoped
* safety_ethics_risk: 1=nontrivial ethical/safety risks or misuse potential; 3=some manageable risks; 5=low risk, clear mitigations

# WEIGHTS (sum to 1.0)

Use these defaults unless WEIGHTS_OVERRIDE is provided:
{
"originality_novelty": 0.20,
"relevance_alignment": 0.15,
"feasibility_resources": 0.15,
"testability_falsifiability": 0.10,
"methodological_rigor": 0.10,
"literature_grounding": 0.10,
"potential_impact": 0.10,
"clarity_specificity": 0.05,
"safety_ethics_risk": 0.05
}

# MAPPING RULES (Multi-topic)

* topic_id: derive from the enclosing <SEED_MARKDOWN>/<IDEAS_JSON> block's topic_id attribute; if an idea object contains "Topic" or "TopicId", that overrides. If still unknown, assign "topic_XX" with 2-digit index per unseen topic, starting at 01.
* idea_id: prefer the idea's "Name"; if absent, use "idea_XX" with 2-digit index starting at 01 within its topic.
* title: use "Title" if present; else null.
* When forming justifications, draw evidence from these fields where available: "Short Hypothesis"/"Description", "Abstract", "Related Work", "Experiments"/"Methodology", "Research Questions", "Expected Outcomes", "Risk Factors and Limitations".
* If a field is missing or empty, treat as null and avoid speculation.
* Safety/ethics: consider risks mentioned in "Risk Factors and Limitations" and any plausible concerns given the seed.

# SCORING RULES

* For each idea, assign integer scores 1–5 for all nine norms.
* Compute overall_weighted_score ∈ [1,5] = sum_i (weight_i * score_i).
* Provide a short justification_evidence list (2–4 bullet strings; no chain-of-thought, just concise evidence snippets grounded in the idea text).
* Provide red_flags (0–3 short strings) for any critical issues.
* Provide verdict in {"accept","revise","reject"} using these guides:
  * accept: overall ≥ 4.2 AND no critical red flags
  * revise: 3.2–4.19 OR promising idea with fixable issues
  * reject: < 3.2 OR major unfixable risk/mismatch
* If a field is truly not inferable, set it to null (not empty string).

# OUTPUT FORMAT — SINGLE JSON OBJECT ONLY (WRITTEN TO FILE)

Schema (types):
{
"seed_summaries": [
  {
    "topic_id": "string",
    "title": "string",
    "keywords": ["string", ...]
  }
],
"weights_used": {<norm>: number, ...}, // sums to 1.0
"ideas": [
{
"topic_id": "string",
"idea_id": "string", // prefer the 'Name' field; else use index like "idea_01" within topic
"title": "string|null",
"scores": {

"relevance_alignment": 1,
"feasibility_resources": 1,
"testability_falsifiability": 1,
"methodological_rigor": 1,
"literature_grounding": 1,
"potential_impact": 1,
"clarity_specificity": 1,
"safety_ethics_risk": 1
},
"overall_weighted_score": 3.000, // numeric, 3 decimals
"verdict": "accept|revise|reject",
"justification_evidence": ["string", ...], // 2–4 short bullets
"red_flags": ["string", ...] // 0–3 items; [] if none
}
],
"ranking_by_overall": ["topic_id/idea_id_highest_first", ...], // global sort desc by overall_weighted_score; break ties by higher originality_novelty then feasibility_resources
"ranking_by_topic": { "topic_id": ["idea_id_highest_first", ...], ... } // per-topic rankings, same tie-breakers
}

# STRICT OUTPUT RULES

* Write ONLY valid JSON per the schema above.
* No markdown. No commentary. No trailing commas. Use 3 decimal places for overall_weighted_score.
* If WEIGHTS_OVERRIDE is present in the prompt (JSON object with the same keys), use it verbatim and echo it in "weights_used".
* Do not print anything else; the file is the sole output artifact.
