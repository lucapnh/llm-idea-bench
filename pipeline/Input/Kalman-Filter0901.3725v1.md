A clear, implementation-oriented walkthrough of the Ensemble Kalman Filter that replaces full covariance matrices with sample covariances from an ensemble, enabling scalable Bayesian updates in high-dimensional models and outlining key extensions such as localization and morphing variants.

## Abstract

This tutorial introduces the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) as a practical Monte-Carlo realization of Bayesian filtering for systems with very large state spaces, such as discretized geophysical models. Starting from the classical Kalman filter’s Gaussian assumptions, it motivates EnKF by the prohibitive cost of evolving full covariance matrices and shows how an ensemble of state realizations—with sample mean and sample covariance—can approximate the posterior update while advancing each member independently through the model dynamics. The paper derives the basic perturbed-observations analysis step, emphasizes an “observation-matrix–free” formulation that only requires evaluating an observation function $h(x)$, and presents numerically stable implementations (e.g., Cholesky solves and Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury) that are well suited for many observations and diagonal (or cheaply factorizable) error covariances. It clarifies theoretical points often glossed over—namely that ensemble members are not strictly i.i.d. nor jointly Gaussian—while noting convergence to the Kalman filter as ensemble size grows. The tutorial also surveys extensions addressing practical limitations: covariance tapering and localization for rank-deficient covariances, square-root/adjustment variants that avoid data perturbations, and morphing approaches for coherent, position-error-dominated features. Related hybrid and particle-inspired methods are briefly reviewed as routes beyond strict Gaussianity. Overall, the article balances derivation, numerics, and pointers to extensions, making it a concise guide for implementing EnKF in high-dimensional, real-time data assimilation settings.
